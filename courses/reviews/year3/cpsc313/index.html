<h2 id="course-format">Course Format</h2>
<p>There are many many many questions in this course. First, there are pre-class videos which have a set of pre-class questions for you answer. Then there are in-class questions. There are weekly assignments in C or assembly, and biweeklyish quizzes.</p>
<h2 id="importance-of-course">Importance of Course</h2>
<p>For most people who want to work in a higher-level environment like web development, this course probably doesn't offer any explicit value. Obviously, if you're interested in low-level programming, this course is pretty valuable.</p>
<h2 id="my-thoughts">My thoughts</h2>
<p>This is one of those courses where you will like a lot, or not like much at all. Most CS majors try to postpone this course until the last year of their degree, but I personally was excited for this course. You see, I'm interested in systems programming, so this course was a lot easier and interesting for me than CPSC 320. I found this course less demanding than CPSC 213.</p>
