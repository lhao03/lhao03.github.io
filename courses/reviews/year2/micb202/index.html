<h2 id="overall-thoughts">Overall thoughts:</h2>
<p>One of the most interesting courses I've taken at UBC. The instructors were so forgiving during the pandemic and they worked hard to create unique and fun assignments. We learned about the immune system, viruses, and bacterial diseases, which is pretty fitting for right now. The instructors were also knowledgeable about their topics at hand and I highly recommend this course to anyone interested in their immune system and viruses. Exam questions were very fair and we even had an assignment in which we were given a mystery virus and tasked to find which known virus it was most similar with.</p>
<p>While this course is also a lot of memorization of content the instructors were very understanding of student's circumstances and worked hard on creating super engaging and interesting assignments.</p>
