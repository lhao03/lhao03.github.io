<h2 id="what-to-expect">What to expect:</h2>
<p>Easy booster course but if you don't enjoy memorizing sentence after sentence after sentence, then this course will be a bore for you. I did not enjoy this course at all, and dreaded doing the readings and quizzes. With that being said, it is a booster course and I did get an A+.</p>
<p>I think there were some Canvas quizzes and this like webpage like assignment (I think it was optional). It was all self learning, no lectures, just reading pages of notes on Canvas.</p>
<h2 id="overall-thoughts">Overall thoughts:</h2>
<p>If you like going hiking, skiing, etc, this course may be for you. This course goes over cloud trends, weather trends, mountains, different types of snow climate (honestly I don't remember much). Unfortunately for me, I do none of those activities and I don't really enjoy learning about these topics, so this course was a waste of time for me. Additionally, I don't do well with memorization heavy courses (unless I really really like what I'm memorizing). This course being distance learning made it much worse.</p>
<p>Don't take this course unless there is absolutely nothing else that interests you (if you're trying to cover science breadth) or if you're okay with memorizing stuff. Honestly, you could just ctrl-f through the notes and you'll pass for sure.</p>
