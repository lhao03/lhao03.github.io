- Fundamentals of statistical mechanics: NVT, NVE, Î¼VT, NPT Ensembles.
- Application to systems of non-interacting particles including Fermi-Dirac and Bose-Einstein statistics, and the Bose condensation.
- Classical statistical mechanics including the general (p, q) formulation, and the Maxwell-Boltzmann velocity distribution.
- Statistical mechanics of interaction systems including virial expansions, thermodynamic perturbation theory, distribution function theory, and computer simulation methods

* questions
- how to differentiate between mechanical property and thermodynamic property?
- what are restrictions on what values microstates can have?
  - depends on the ensemble

* lecture 1
*** basic ideas
- general points:
  - why different types of ensembles? not all problems can be easily solved in all ensembles, you can and should (?) reach the same conclusions
  - non-interacting particles:
    - classical: ideal gas law, boring
      - need interactions for things to happen
    - quantum: interesting, electrons and bosons
  - statistical mechanics needs QM
    - can approximate with CM
- macroscopic ideas depend on average behaviour of particles in system
  - mechanic vs thermodynamic properties
    - mechanical properties depend on the mechanics of system
      - defined for each microstate
- consider an NVT ensemble:
  - macroscopic: determine an equilibrium state
    - observe thermodynamic properties (if at thermodynamic limit)
  - microscopic: many microscopic states (microstates) from QM with CM approximations
    - with many different instantaneous values of E, P, etc
    - to do a calculation: must specify # & type of matter, # of microstates and their energies, etc (?? what is etc)
  - $$\text{microscopic level (QM)} \xrightarrow[\text{mechanics}]{\text{statistical}} \text{macroscopic level (thermodynamics)}$$
- thermodynamics: basedon laws which are true
- SM: based on postulates which may or may not be true
- SM postulates:
  1. all macroscopic observables obtained from average over different microstates (Schrodinger). we do not need any dynamic information
     - ensemble: infinite number of systems which can be different microscopically but cannot be distinguished macroscopically
       - take a snapshot of every system, we have all microstates $$\rightarrow$$ macroscopic properties
    - what microstates are possible? QM
    - how are these microstates distributed (aka probability of finding a microstate with energy E) for a given system in equilibrium? Boltzmann Distribution
  2. if microstates of a system have the same energy, they are equally probable (the principle of equal a priori probabilities)
     - systems with same energy are equally likely to occur in ensemble
- find P(E)
*** deriving boltzmann distribution
* lecture 2
- NVT ensemble: 2 systems with fixed temperature
  - $$P_A(E_A)$$, $$P_B(E_B)$$, $$P_{A+B}(E_{A+B})$$
  - because system A and B are independent, we can say $$P_{A+B}(E_{A+B}) = P_A(E_A)P_B(E_B)$$
  - apply the mathematical aside:
    $$\begin{align}
    \frac{\partial P_{A+B}(E_A + E_B)}{\partial E_A} \\
    &= \frac{\partial P_A(E_A)P_B(E_B)}{\partial E_A} \Big|_{E_B} \\
    &= P_A^\prime(E_A)P_B(E_B)
    \end{align}$$
    $$\begin{align}
    \frac{\partial P_A(E_A)P_B(E_B)}{\partial E_B} \Big|_{E_A} \\
    &= P_B^\prime(E_B)P_A(E_A)
    \end{align}$$
    $$ P_A^\prime(E_A)P_B(E_B) = P_B^\prime(E_B)P_A(E_A) \\
    \frac{P_A^\prime(E_A)}{P_A(E_A)} = \frac{P_B^\prime(E_B)}{P_B(E_B)} = - \beta$$
    - this ratio must equal a constant because: LHS depends on $E_A$ and RHS depends on $RHS$ but they equal each other
      - $-\beta$ does not depend on anything but temperature and Boltzmann constant
        $$\begin{align}
        \frac{1}{P_A(E_A)}\frac{\partial P_A(E_A)}{\partial E_A} &= - \beta \\
        \frac{1}{P_A(E_A)}\partial P_A(E_A) &= - \beta \partial E_A \\
        \int \frac{P_A(E_A)}{P_A(E_A)} \partial (ln P_A(E_A)) &= \int - \beta \partial E_A \\
        ln P_A(E_A) &= - \beta E_A + c \\
        P_A(E_A) &= ce^{-\beta E_A} \\
        \end{align}$$ (https://www.cs.uleth.ca/~holzmann/notes/diffrules.pdf)
  - probability of finding Kth microstate: $$P(E_K) = \frac{1}{Q}e^{-\beta E_K}$$
  - more interested in finding a microstate of an energy level: introduce degeneracies (from quantization of energy, QM) $$\rightarrow P_l(E) = \Omega(E)P(E)$$
    - degeneracies increase with increasing energy, $P(E)$ decreases with increasing energy
