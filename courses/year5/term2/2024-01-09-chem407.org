---

- Fundamentals of statistical mechanics: N V T , N V E, Î¼V T , N P T Ensembles.
- Application to systems of non-interacting particles including Fermi-Dirac and Bose-Einstein statistics, and the Bose condensation.
- Classical statistical mechanics including the general (p, q) formulation, and the Maxwell-Boltzmann velocity distribution.
- Statistical mechanics of interaction systems including virial expansions, thermodynamic perturbation theory, distribution function theory, and computer simulation methods

* lecture 1
- macroscropic ideas depend on average behaviour of particles in system
- postulates:
  1. all macroscopic observables obtained from average over different microstates (no dynamic information)
  2.
