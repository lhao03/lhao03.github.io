---

- Fundamentals of statistical mechanics: N V T , N V E, Î¼V T , N P T Ensembles.
- Application to systems of non-interacting particles including Fermi-Dirac and Bose-Einstein statistics, and the Bose condensation.
- Classical statistical mechanics including the general (p, q) formulation, and the Maxwell-Boltzmann velocity distribution.
- Statistical mechanics of interaction systems including virial expansions, thermodynamic perturbation theory, distribution function theory, and computer simulation methods

* lecture 1
- general points:
  - why different types of ensembles? not all problems can be easily solved in all ensembles, you can and should (?) reach the same conclusions
  - non-interacting particles:
    - classical: ideal gas law, boring
      - need interactions for things to happen
    - quantum: interesting, electrons and bosons
  - statistical mechanics needs QM
    - can approximate with CM
- macroscopic ideas depend on average behaviour of particles in system
  - mechanic vs thermodynamic properties (??: kind of confused on this?)
    - mechanical properties depend on the mechanics of system
- consider an NVT ensemble:
  - macroscopic: determine an equilibrium state
    - observe thermodynamic properties (if at thermodynamic limit)
  - microscopic: many microscopic states (microstates) from QM with CM approximations
    - with many different instantaneous values of E, P, etc (??: what are the restrictions on these values)
    - to do a calculation: must specify # & type of matter, # of microstates and their energies, etc (?? what is etc)
  - microscopic level (QM) $$\xrightarrow[\text{statistical}]{\text{mechanics}}$$ macroscopic level (thermodynamics)
- postulates:
  1. all macroscopic observables obtained from average over different microstates (no dynamic information)
  2.
