- historically: incinerated compound in presence of $O_2$
  - canisters caught the oxidized versions of the compound
- types of EA
- empirical vs. molecular formula
- problem types:
  - find empirical formula based on $$C_xH_yO_z$$ sample submitted for analysis
    1. write out balanced combustion equation
    2. calculate mmol of atomic elements present in sample based on given $$H_2O$$ and $$CO_2$$ (combustion products)
    3. find mass of atomic elements present in sample
    4. calculate percent weight of atomic elements present in sample
    5. check if precents sum to 100% (or if don't there is oxygen in sample)
    6. assume 100g of sample, % is g of atomic elemental
    7. divide through by lowest mole to find empirical formula
  - find molecular formula given empirical formula: $$MF = X EF$$
  - $$IHD  = \frac{\# \text{ H saturated compound} - \# \text{ H unsaturated compound}}{2}$$
    - group V: add one H
    - group VI: no change
    - group VII: subtract one H
    - problem types:
      - calculate IHD:
        - check for molecules from the mentioned groups. apply proper addition or subtraction of saturated hydrogens
    - rule of 13: high resolution mass spectroscopy (HRMS) gives us mass in amu
      - $$\frac{M}{13} = n + \frac{r}{13}$$
        - $$C_nH_{n+r}$$ and $$IHD = U = \frac{n-r+2}{2}$$
        - steps to solve problem:
          1. use rule of 13 calculate base molecular formula and IHD by dividing the given amu by 13 and setting the fraction part as $$r$$
          2. adjust base molecular and IHD for addition of other molecules if required.
             - subtract from the base molecular formula
             - add to IHD/U

** nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy
*** Fundamentals (jan 15)
- spectroscopy: study of interaction between matter and EMR
- NMR: interaction of EMR and nucleus of atom
  - $^13$C and $^1$H
- NMR active nuclei: odd mass or odd atomic number
  - quantized spin angular momentum $m_s$ and magnetic momentum
  - nuclear spin quantum number I:  $^13$C: $1/2$ and $^1$H: $1/2$
  - allowed spin states: $2I + 1$
  - in absence of magnetic field, all spin states are degenerate
- nuclear spin in an applied field
  - when charged particle spins, creates magnetic field
  - spin states no longer degenerate in applied magnetic field
    - aligned: lower energy
    - oppsing: higher energy
- alpha/beta spin states
  - alpha: aligned with field (lower energy)
  - beta: opposing the field (higher energy)
  - when external magnetic field applied, degenerate spin states split into two states, lower energy state is aligned with magnetic field and higher energy state
    - energy gap increases with increasing magnetic field strength
