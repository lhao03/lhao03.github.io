- historically: incinerated compound in presence of $O_2$
  - canisters caught the oxidized versions of the compound
- types of EA
- empirical vs. molecular formula
- problem types:
  - find empirical formula based on $$C_xH_yO_z$$ sample submitted for analysis
    1. write out balanced combustion equation
    2. calculate mmol of atomic elements present in sample based on given $$H_2O$$ and $$CO_2$$ (combustion products)
    3. find mass of atomic elements present in sample
    4. calculate percent weight of atomic elements present in sample
    5. check if precents sum to 100% (or if don't there is oxygen in sample)
    6. assume 100g of sample, % is g of atomic elemental
    7. divide through by lowest mole to find empirical formula
  - find molecular formula given empirical formula: $$MF = X EF$$
  - $$IHD  = \frac{\# \text{ H saturated compound} - \# \text{ H unsaturated compound}}{2}$$
    - group V: add one H
    - group VI: no change
    - group VII: subtract one H
    - problem types:
      - calculate IHD:
        - check for molecules from the mentioned groups. apply proper addition or subtraction of saturated hydrogens
    - rule of 13: high resolution mass spectroscopy (HRMS) gives us mass in amu
      - $$\frac{M}{13} = n + \frac{r}{13}$$
        - $$C_nH_{n+r}$$ and $$IHD = U = \frac{n-r+2}{2}$$
        - steps to solve problem:
          1. use rule of 13 calculate base molecular formula and IHD by dividing the given amu by 13 and setting the fraction part as $$r$$
          2. adjust base molecular and IHD for addition of other molecules if required.
             - subtract from the base molecular formula
             - add to IHD/U

** nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy
*** Fundamentals (jan 15)
- spectroscopy: study of interaction between matter and EMR
- NMR: interaction of EMR and nucleus of atom
  - $^13$C and $^1$H
- NMR active nuclei: odd mass or odd atomic number
  - quantized spin angular momentum $m_s$ and magnetic momentum
  - nuclear spin quantum number I:  $^13$C: $1/2$ and $^1$H: $1/2$
  - allowed spin states: $2I + 1$
  - in absence of magnetic field, all spin states are degenerate
- nuclear spin in an applied field
  - when charged particle spins, creates magnetic field
  - spin states no longer degenerate in applied magnetic field
    - aligned: lower energy
    - oppsing: higher energy
- alpha/beta spin states
  - alpha: aligned with field (lower energy)
  - beta: opposing the field (higher energy)
  - when external magnetic field applied, degenerate spin states split into two states, lower energy state is aligned with magnetic field and higher energy state
    - energy gap increases with increasing magnetic field strength
*** Chemical shift, $$^{13}C$$ (Tutorial 3)
- how many $\alpha$ and $\beta$ will there be?
  - boltzmann distribution
  - need nuclei (alpha or beta) to be in excess to see any signal
    - excess nuclei depends on how much sample and how strong the external magnetic field is
- larmor frequency: the frequency that a nuclei begins to precess it's own axis
  - nuclei wobble in presence of applied magnetic field
  - larmor frequency is unique to every nuclei
- how does NMR occur?
  - nuclei aligned with an applied magnetic field absorb energy, flip and relax back down
  - we only see nuclei in excess
- what does NMR tell us
  - chemical shift: chemical environment
  - multiplicity: neighbouring NMR active nuclei
  - integration: # eq protons
  - coupling constants: type of interactions with other nuclei of same type
- what does sheilding/deshielded mean?
  - valence electrons circulate in applied magnetic field
  - the induced magnetic field from electrons opposes applied field
  - more electron density -> more sheilded (right)
  - less electron density -> more deshielded (left)
- $^{13}$C NMR Table
  - 0 - 50 ppm: saturated carbon (no EWG)
  - 25 - 80 ppm: saturated carbon (EWG)
  - 60 - 80 ppm: alkyne
  - 100 - 180 ppm: unsaturated carbon sp$^2$, aromatic ring
  - 150 - up ppm: carbonyl ring, aldehyde, ketone
- tips for $^{13}$C NMR
  - methyl groups sheild neighbouring Cs
  - the more substituted a carbon is, the more deshielded it becomes
  - ppm increases from electronegativity, increasing number EWG, decreasing distance between carbon and EWG
- why is alkyne more sheilded than alkene? anisotropy
  - EWG remove electron density
  - in presence of applied magnetic field, electrons in pi bonds circulate, creating induced magnetic field
  - areas are more shielded or more deshielded than expected
