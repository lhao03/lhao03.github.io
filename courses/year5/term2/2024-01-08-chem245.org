** elemental analysis and IHD review
*** learning objectives:
- empirical vs. molecular formula
  - calculate and distinguish
- identify components of elemental analysis equipment
- define Index of Hydrogen $$\delta$$ or IHD
- calculate IHD from:
    - chemical structure
    - molecular formulae
    - amu
- rule of 13
- provide possible structures using provided and calculated IHD

**** jan 8
- historically: incinerated compound in presence of $O_2$
  - canisters caught the oxidized versions of the compound
- types of EA
- empirical vs. molecular formula
- problem types:
  - find empirical formula based on $$C_xH_yO_z$$ sample submitted for analysis
    1. write out balanced combustion equation
    2. calculate mmol of atomic elements present in sample based on given $$H_2O$$ and $$CO_2$$ (combustion products)
    3. find mass of atomic elements present in sample
    4. calculate percent weight of atomic elements present in sample
    5. check if precents sum to 100% (or if don't there is oxygen in sample)
    6. assume 100g of sample, % is g of atomic elemental
    7. divide through by lowest mole to find empirical formula
  - find molecular formula given empirical formula: $$MF = X EF$$
  - $$IHD  = \frac{\# \text{ H saturated compound} - \# \text{ H unsaturated compound}}{2}$$
    - group V: add one H
    - group VI: no change
    - group VII: subtract one H
    - problem types:
      - calculate IHD:
        - check for molecules from the mentioned groups. apply proper addition or subtraction of saturated hydrogens
