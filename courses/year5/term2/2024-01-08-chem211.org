* questions
- how does $$N \varpropto \sqrt{n}$$ imply averaged noise, being random, tends to cancel out?
* units
*** Course Introduction
- analytical chemistry: obtaining, processing, communicating information about composition/structure of matter
  - what matter is present and how much
- trends: personalized technology
- making good measurements and know if those measurements are good
** Analytical concepts
*** An Introduction to Analytical Measurements
*** lecture 1
- the scientific method:
  1. formulate question
  2. sampling (??)
  3. sampling preparation
  4. analysis
  5. interpretation
  6. draw conclusions
- assay is process of determining the amount of analyte (substance being measured) in sample
- qualitative (identification) vs. quantitative (quantity) of components
- signal
  - visual: simple, low-cost, subjective, not sensitive, large sample volumes, low-throughput (??)
  - electrical detection: objective, more sensitive, faster, automate, costly, maintenance, calibration
    - voltage
    - current
    - transducer
- measurement: can get signal and noise (unwanted, random fluctuations in background)
  - signal-to-noise ratio
  - multiple scans acquired and averaged to increase S/N $$\frac{S}{N} \varpropto \sqrt{n}$$ and $$N$$ adds randomly
*** lecture 2
- additions to scientific method: analyze, interpret and report data
- terminology:
  - assay: set of procedures or methods, latin word for try
  - analyte: chemical we are looking for
  - qualitative analysis
  - quantitative analysis
  - signal:
    - visual: subjective, low throughput
    - electrical detection: objective, costly, calibration
      - transducer: converts output from experiment into electrical output
  - measurement:
    - signal: can be height or area of line/graph (thing we want) (mean of several measurements)
    - noise: unwanted, random fluctuations (sd)
    - want big s/n noise ratio
  - signal/noise ratio:
    - multiple measurements/averaging increases S/N
      - $$S \varpropto n, N \varpropto \sqrt{n}$$ where $n$ is number of measurements
    - depends on having relatively quick scans (increase S)
    - system signal has to be stable
  - sample matrix: everything but the analyte.
    - matrix: complex and often unknown
  - blank: chemist made sample that lacks analyte
    - types:
      - solvent: same solvent as sample solutions
      - method: same solvents and reagents
      - sample: tries to approximate the sample matrix, everything but analyte
  - detection limit:
    - noise:
    - blank:
    - limit of detection (LOD):

* lab notes
** introduction to statistics
- assumption: data randomly distributed in normal (gaussian) distribution
- estimation of precision: standard deviation
- outlier: Grubb's test
- comparing two standard deviations: F test
- comparing two means: Student's t-test
- statistics of repeated measurements:
  - absolute uncertainty: uncertainty described directly in the units of measurement
    - absolute error: uncertainty from instrument or equipment
    - reproducible and source of origin known
  - relative uncertainty: percentage of magnitude of quantity measured
