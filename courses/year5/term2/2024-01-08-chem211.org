- can we generalize the error propagation for $y^x$?
- what does sd of noise mean?
  - why is this $$S/N = 3$$ if $$S_mb = 0$$ important
- what does concentration detection limit mean

* units
*** Course Introduction
- analytical chemistry: obtaining, processing, communicating information about composition/structure of matter
  - what matter is present and how much
- trends: personalized technology
- making good measurements and know if those measurements are good
** Analytical concepts
*** An Introduction to Analytical Measurements
*** lecture 1
- the scientific method:
  1. formulate question
  2. sampling (??)
  3. sampling preparation
  4. analysis
  5. interpretation
  6. draw conclusions
- assay is process of determining the amount of analyte (substance being measured) in sample
- qualitative (identification) vs. quantitative (quantity) of components
- signal
  - visual: simple, low-cost, subjective, not sensitive, large sample volumes, low-throughput (??)
  - electrical detection: objective, more sensitive, faster, automate, costly, maintenance, calibration
    - voltage
    - current
    - transducer
- measurement: can get signal and noise (unwanted, random fluctuations in background)
  - signal-to-noise ratio
  - multiple scans acquired and averaged to increase S/N $$\frac{S}{N} \varpropto \sqrt{n}$$ and $$N$$ adds randomly
*** lecture 2
- additions to scientific method: analyze, interpret and report data
- terminology:
  - assay: set of procedures or methods, latin word for try
  - analyte: chemical we are looking for
  - qualitative analysis
  - quantitative analysis
  - signal:
    - visual: subjective, low throughput
    - electrical detection: objective, costly, calibration
      - transducer: converts output from experiment into electrical output
  - measurement:
    - signal: can be height or area of line/graph (thing we want) (mean of several measurements)
    - noise: unwanted, random fluctuations (sd)
    - want big s/n noise ratio
  - signal/noise ratio:
    - multiple measurements/averaging increases S/N
      - $$S \varpropto n, N \varpropto \sqrt{n}$$ where $n$ is number of measurements
    - depends on having relatively quick scans (increase S)
    - system signal has to be stable
  - sample matrix: everything but the analyte.
    - matrix: complex and often unknown
  - blank: chemist made sample that lacks analyte
    - types:
      - solvent: same solvent as sample solutions
      - method: same solvents and reagents
      - sample: tries to approximate the sample matrix, everything but analyte
  - detection limit:
    - ability to detect analyte
    - $$C_{LOD} = \frac{3\sigma_{mb}}{m}$$
    - noise: random fluctuations in measured signal
    - blank: a constant (like control) signal measured in absence of analyte
    - limit of detection (LOD): smallest concentration of absolute amount of analyte with signal much larger than blank
      - signal that is greater than mean of blank + three sds of the noise
    - signal LOD: units as signal (instrument maker)
      - $$(S_A)_{DL} = S_{mb} + z\sigma_{mb}, z = 3$$
        - 99.7 confidence, $$S/N = 3$$ if $$S_mb = 0$$
    - sample LOD: amount/concentration (user)
      - take signal LOD and convert to eq concentration via calibration
- limit of quantitation $$\frac{S}{N} = 10$$
  - ability to report the concentration
    - $$C_{LOQ} = \frac{10\sigma_{mb}}{m}$$

- controls:
  - positive: standard sample with known quantity of analyte
    - prevents situation when there should be a signal but there is no signal (false negative)
  - negative: standard sample with no analyete
    - prevents situation when there should be no signal and there is a signal (false positive)
- figures of merit
  - LOD, LOQ
  - accuracy & precision
    - closeness of experimental value to true value
    - agreement among a set of measurements (reproducible?) (sd)
      - error and replicates:
        - absolute: $$\bar{x} - \mu$$
        - relative: $$\frac{\bar{x} - \mu}{\mu} \times 100 \%$$
      - replicate: samples from same source
  - selectivity
    - extent that other substances interfere with determination of analyte
      - interferences: chemical that causes systematic error in measured quantity
        - act on analyte
        - act on reagent being used in detection
        - be source of large background signal
        - cause negative/positive bias
        - cause absolute/proportional errors
      - masking agent: prevents components in sample matrix from interfering with analysis
  - sensitivity
    - ability of method to measure small changes in concentration of analyte
      - slope of calibration curve
  - range: acceptable linearity, accuracy, precision
    - dynamic range: range an instrument can read (measurable response but maybe not linear)
    - linear range: analyte concentration over which response is proportional to concentration
  - robustness
    - ability of method to withstand small, uncontrolled changes in operation parameters
- why FOM: demonstrate validity of method by reporting these parameters
- uncertainty and bias:
  - random uncertainty: can't replicate, contributes to imprecision, quantify with stats
  - systematic uncertainty: contribute to inaccuracy, repeatable, can correct for it in principle
    - instrument: can usually be corrected
    - method: difficult to identify and correct
    - personal: sloppy
    - types:
      - proportional: %, issue for large signals
      - constant: always some absolute value, issue for small signals
- calibration curves:
  - external calibration: in the lab: series of solutions of known concentration of analyte
  - graph of signal vs. concentration: calibration
  - linear or non-linear, use interpolation to find concentration (based on signal)
  - linear regression: minimize the sum of squares of residuals
    - least squares method: minimize residuals between data points and line
      - residual (at the same x): experimental y - line of best fit y
  - if original sample was diluted, apply dilution factor
- concentration detection limit: lowest concentration of analyte in sample that can be detected
  - you can find concentration LOD: $$[C]_{DL} = \frac{3\sigma_{mb}}{m}$$
- matrix effects: combined effect of non-analyte components in sample on measurement of analyte
  - calibration standards should approximate analytical samples in analyte and in composition of non-analyte species
  - matrix too complex, so use standard addition
- standard addition:
  - wet lab: prepare standard solutions but with sample and add analyte to "sample"
  - find x-intercept: when y = 0, this is the "original" value of x (without the shift in y axis)
  - the linear line has been "shifted" on the y axis
    [[../../../../images/211/standard_addition.jpeg]]
*** lecture 4
- internal standard: intentionally add substance that is not expected to be found in sample (not the analyte) but behaves similarly
  - constant amount of internal standard, constant IS signal
  - changing concentrations of analyte
  - plot ratio between analyte and internal standard vs. ratio of their concentrations $$\frac{S_{A}}{S_{IS}}$$ vs. $$\frac{[A]}{[IS]}$$
- calibration curve:
  1. single point calibration (one standard) and the origin
  2. multi-point calibration (4-6)
     - effect of systematic error in any one standard solution minimized by existence of other standards

- sig figs:
  - pH: pH of 2.45, digits after decimal are how many sig figs the conc. has
  - exact number has infinite number of sig figs
*** Analytical Measurements and Statistics - Gaussian Distribution, Standard Deviation
- gaussian distribution: bell curve
  - 1sd: 68%
  - 2sd: 95%
  - 3sd; 99%
- population vs. sample:
  - sample sd approaches population sd as N > 20
  - as N increases, sd decreases
- propagation of uncertainty:
  - addition/sub: $$\sqrt{\sigma^2_a + \sigma^2_b}$$
  - mult/div: RSD used
*** Analytical Measurements and Statistics - Significance Testing
- significance testing: is difference between two values too large to be explained by random uncertainty
| case 1 t-test           | case 2 t test               | case 3 t-test       | grubb's test |
| compare experi. to true | compare two experi. results | compare two methods | outlier?     |
- null hypothesis: no effect
- choose CI before you do experiments
  - CI: probability a difference exists when it doesn't
- student's t value: permits use of sample data to test hypothesis without knowing population sd
  - as N decreases, t increases

* lab notes
** introduction to statistics
- assumption: data randomly distributed in normal (gaussian) distribution
- estimation of precision: standard deviation
- outlier: Grubb's test
- comparing two standard deviations: F test
- comparing two means: Student's t-test
- statistics of repeated measurements:
  - absolute uncertainty: uncertainty described directly in the units of measurement
    - absolute error: uncertainty from instrument or equipment
    - reproducible and source of origin known
  - relative uncertainty: percentage of magnitude of quantity measured
    - no units, expressed as percentage
- mean, sd, confidence limits
  - sd: random scatter (s)
  - relative sd: $$\frac{s}{\bar{x}} \times 100\%$$
  - confidence limits: range that you are confident that true value falls
    - number of sds that must be used for different confidence levels is student's t value $$\bar{x}\pm\frac{ts}{\sqrt{N}}$$
    - table t value: requires confidence level (95%) and degrees of freedom (N - 1) where N is number of measurements
- propagation of uncertainty (where $y$ is the answer after doing these operations)
  - addition/subtraction: $$e_y = \sqrt{\sum_{n=1}^N e^2_{x_n}}$$
  - multiplication/division: $$e_y = y\sqrt{\sum_{n=1}^N (\frac{e_{x_n}}{x_n})^2}$$
  - $$y = log(x)$$: $$e_y =  \frac{1}{ln(10)}\frac{e_x}{x}$$
  - $$y = ln(x)$$: $$e_y = \frac{e_x}{x}$$
  - powers of 10 raised to $x$: $$e_y = y ln(10) e_x$$
  - powers of e raised to $x$:  $$e_y = y e_x$$
- sig figs and presenting results:
  1. uncertainty of measurement is larger than instrument's uncertainty
     - sd determines uncertainty of measurement
     - if uncertainty is larger than instrument's uncertainty, the first non zero digit of sd is last sig dig in mean
     - report as $$0.xyz_l \pm 0.00s_d$$
     - sd is reported as one digit, the decimal places of mean and sd must match, record the value after the last sig dig as subscript
  2. uncertainty is smaller than instrument's uncertainty
     - can't use first rule, otherwise reported uncertainty (sd) is lower than instrument uncertainty which cannot be true
     - report answer to same number of digits as instrument's readout
- statistics of linear regression analysis
  1. calibration curve analysis (pure compound dissolved in pure water):
     - prepare series of standard solutions containing known concentration of analyte -> measure property of substance -> plot calibration curve
       - goodness of fit: correlation coefficient $$R^2$$
       - once CC established, unknown solutions can be measured and concentration calculated from: $$C = \frac{(A-b)}{m}$$ where C is concentration, A is measured property, b is y-intercept, m is slope
     - measure of precision is sd: sd of result must be calculated taking into account precision of the calibration curve $$s_x$$
       - depends on sd of slope, regression
       - number of values measured for CC
       - number of times the sample was measured
       - square of distance of unknown measurement from center of calibration curve $$(\bar{y_k}-\bar{y})^2$$
         - closer the measurement is made to the ends of calibration curve, the larger the deviation
     - confidence limits for values $$CL = x \pm t \dot s_x$$
       - $t$ value taken at desired confidence level and $(N-2)$ degrees of freedom (because need two points to specify a line)
     - beer's law
       - spectrophotometric analysis: theory -> light of wavelength $$\lambda$$ and power $$P_o$$/intensity $$I_o$$ enters a sample that absorbs that wavelength, sample molecules raised to excited state and exiting $$P$$ of light will be less. $$T = \frac{I}{I_o} = \frac{P}{P_o)}$$
       - measure of $$I_o$$ with no sample present, then measure $$I$$ with sample present: $$A = mC + b$$
       - transmittance vs. concentration is a exponentially decreasing, so $$A = -log T$$
         - absorbance is directly proportional to concentration of light-absorbing substance: $$A = abC = \epsilon bC$$, b is path length, A is absorbance, C is concentration, a is proportionality constant called absorptivity
           - linear calibration plot
       - plot absorbance vs. concentration to get ab or $$\epsilon b$$ (will be linear)
  2. standard addition analysis
     - complex samples
       - matrix effect can be minimized in two ways:
         1. add standard solution so same substances as unknown sample (same matrix in all solutions)
         2. prepare standard solutions from sample rather than pure analyte and pure solvent
            1. measure property of unknown solution
            2. add known amount of analyte to sample and measure again
               - if $$vol_{sample} >> vol_{analyte}$$, will have around same matrix
       - or pipetting equal volumes of unknown solution into vol. flask and adding known amount of analyte to one, diluting both
         - spiking, and matrix stays the same for both (standard addition method)
         - absorbance vs. concentration of spike:
** glassware
pipette
- TD: pipette is accurately calibrated to deliver specified volume of liquid
  - delivers a specific volume, but holds more
- TC: pipette contains specified volume of liquid with no remainders
  - contain a specific volume
