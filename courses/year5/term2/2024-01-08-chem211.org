* units
*** Course Introduction
- analytical chemistry: obtaining, processing, communicating information about composition/structure of matter
  - what matter is present and how much
- trends: personalized technology
- making good measurements and know if those measurements are good
** Analytical concepts
*** An Introduction to Analytical Measurements
- the scientific method:
  1. formulate question
  2. sampling (??)
  3. sampling preparation
  4. analysis
  5. interpretation
  6. draw conclusions
- assay is process of determining the amount of analyte (substance being measured) in sample
- qualitative (identification) vs. quantitative (quantity) of components
- signal
  - visual: simple, low-cost, subjectice, not sensitive, large sample volumes, low-throughput (??)
  - electrical detection: objective, more sensitive, faster, automate, costly, maintenance, calibration
    - voltage
    - current
    - transducer
- measurement: can get signal and noise (unwanted, random fluctations in background)
  - signal-to-noise ratio
  - multiple scans acquired and averaged to increase S/N $$S \varpropto \sqrt{n}; \frac{S}{N} \varpropto \sqrt{n}$$ and $$N$$ adds randomly

* lab notes
** introduction to statistics
- assumption: data randomly distributed in normal (gaussian) distribution
- estimation of precision: standard deviation
- outlier: Grubb's test
- comparing two standard deviations: F test
- comparing two means: Student's t-test
- statistics of repeated measurements:
  - absolute uncertainty: uncertainty described directly in the units of measurement
    - absolute error: uncertainty from instrument or equipment
    - reproducible and source of origin known
  - relative uncertainty: percentage of magnitude of quantity measured
