* terms
- internal standard: addition of constant amount of substance similar to analyte to a sample as reference point for determination of the analyte
- matrix effect: effect of non-analyte components on sample
- random error:  worse precision
- systematic error: reduces accuracy
- selectivity: measure without interference from other things
- sensitivity: rate of change in signal with changes in analyte
- limit of detection: minimum amount of analyte that be detected with confidence
- precision: how close values are (replicates)
- accuracy: how close to real value
- standard addition: use sample matrix in calibration
- replicate: sample from same source analyzed with same methods
- positive control: known to contain analyte
- negative control: known to contain no analyte
- standard reference material: well characterized
- interferent: cause systematic error in analysis
- t-statistic: assign confidence limits to average results from small sample sizes
- F-test*: compare precision of two methods
- t-test*: compare if two results are same or different statistically
- least squares regression: best fit of line
- G-test: outlier
- For an external standard quantitation, known data from a calibration standard and unknown data from the sample are combined to generate a quantitative report.
- $$K_f = \frac{[MY^{2-}]}{[M^{2+}][Y^{4-}]}$$ usually large
- $$K_sp = [M^+][Cl^-]$$ usually small

* questions
- how does $$N \varpropto \sqrt{n}$$ imply averaged noise, being random, tends to cancel out?
- can we generalize the error propagation for $y^x$?
- what does sd of noise mean?
  - why is this $$S/N = 3$$ if $$S_mb = 0$$ important
- what does concentration detection limit mean

* types of problems
** mt1 problems
*** unit 1
- detecting signals that are statistically significant: $$S \geq \mu_{background} + 3 \sigma_{background}$$
- which t-test to use:
  - case 1: compare sample mean with population mean (the true value) (needs replicates)
  - case 2: use the f-test to compare SD of two sample sets, then compare two sample means (needs replicates)
  - case 3: compare methods of single measurements of several different samples
- $$\frac{S}{N}$$ proportionate to $$\sqrt{n}$$
- concentration detection limit: $$S_A = S_{background} + 3\sigma_{background}$$
- what does each standard allow you do to:
  - external standard: interpolate unknown from CC
  - standard addition: extrapolate unknown from CC (matrix effect)
  - internal standard: ratio, add substance similar to analyte, but different and not expected to be found in sample
*** unit 2
- solubility equilibria: will precipiate form? check if $$Q > K_{sp}$$ using the equation $$[M^+][X^-]$$
- solubility equilibria: with x mL 0.y M of $$MY$$ added to x mL of 0.j M $$NaI$$, how much ppt forms and what is the final concentration
  1. set up reaction equations:
     $$MI \Leftrightarrow M^+ + I^-$$
     $$MY + NaI \leftarrow MI + NaY$$
  2. set up $$K_{sp} = [M^+][I^-]$$, find $[I^-]$
     - assume $$[M^+] = 0$$ at eq, so to find $[I^-]$, you subtract concentration of M from total concentration of I, then solve for M
- complexation equilibria: what is the concentration of $$M^{2+}$$ when x.0 mL of 0.00y M $$MCl_2$$ is added to z.0 mL of 0.00j M of EDTA at pH 13.0

  2. mass balance with known concentrations
  3. assume because of large $$K_f$$ $$[M^{2+}] = 0$$
- solubility equilibria: solubility of $$CoCO_3$$ in buffered solution of pH 4.0
  1. set up equations for $$K_{sp}$$, $$K_{a1}$$, $$K_{a2}$$

  1. given $$K_{sp}$$ and $$K_f$$, write two equations for each one
  2. set up mass balance for $[M^+]$ and $[CN^-]$
  3. list assumptions:
     - since $$K_f$$ is large, there is not much free $M+$
     - MCl will dissolve until all $CN^-$ used up: $$[M(CN)_2^-] >> [CN^-]$$
       - $$[CN^-]_i = 2[M(CN)_2^-] = 0.0x$$ M
       - $$[Ag^+]_i = [Cl^-]_i = [M(CN)_2^-]$$

  1. find equations: $$ACl \Leftrightarrow A^+ + Cl^-$$
  2. set up mass balance: 0.x M = $$[A^+] = [Cl^-]_{total} - [Cl^-]_{XCl} = [Cl^-]_{total} - [X^+]$$
     - because $$[Cl^-]_{XCl} = [X^-]$$

- EDTA titration at pH lower than 10: what is the concentration of $$M^{2+}$$ when x.0 mL of 0.00y0 $$MCl_2$$ is added to z.0 mL of 0.0j M EDTA solution buffered at pH k?
  1. set up $$K_f$$ expression: $$K_f = \frac{[CaY^{2-}]}{[M^{+2}][Y^{4-}]}$$
  2. set up mass balance:
     $$[EDTA] = \frac{z \times 0.0j \text{ M}}{x + z}$$
     $$[MY^{2-}] = \frac{x \times 0.0y \text{ M}}{x + z}$$ assuming all the EDTA forms complex with the metal.
  3. sub in alpha: $$[Y^{4-}] = \alpha_6 [EDTA]_{free}$$
     $$[EDTA]_{free} = [EDTA] - [MY^{2-}]$$
  4. sub in known values into the $$K_f$$ expression to find the concentration of $$M^{2+}$$
     $$[M^{2+}] = \frac{K_f \alpha_6 [EDTA]_{free}}{[MY^{2-}]}$$
- argentometric titration before eq point: x mL of 0.0y M XCl was titrated with 0.z M of $$AgNO_3$$
  - find pCl at 10 mL of $$AgNO_3$$:
    1. calculate how much $$Ag^+$$ has been added; this is how much $Cl^-$ has formed ppt with silver
    2. subtract $Cl^-$ that has formed complex with $Ag^+$ from initial amount of chlorine
    3. $$pCl = log[Cl^-]$$
- argentometric titration at eq: use $$K_{sp}$$

*** Course Introduction
- analytical chemistry: obtaining, processing, communicating information about composition/structure of matter
  - what matter is present and how much
- trends: personalized technology
- making good measurements and know if those measurements are good
** Analytical concepts
*** An Introduction to Analytical Measurements
*** lecture 1
- assay: is process of determining the amount of analyte (substance being measured) in sample
- analyte:
- qualitative analysis: (identification)
  quantitative analysis: (quantity)
- signal
  - visual detection: simple, low-cost, subjective, not sensitive, large sample volumes, low-throughput (??)
  - electrical detection: objective, more sensitive, faster, automate, costly, maintenance, calibration
    - voltage
    - current
    - transducer: converts input stimulus into electrical output
- measurement:
  - signal-to-noise ratio: $$\frac{S}{N}$$ is proportional to $$\sqrt{n}$$
    - averaged signal $$S$$, averaged noise $$N$$
*** lecture 2
  - assay: set of procedures or methods, latin word for try
  - analyte: chemical we are looking for
  - qualitative analysis
  - quantitative analysis
  - measurement:
    - signal: can be height or area of line/graph (thing we want) (mean of several measurements)
    - noise: unwanted, random fluctuations (sd)
  - sample matrix: everything but the analyte.
    - matrix: complex and often unknown
  - blank: chemist made sample that lacks analyte
    - types:
      - solvent: same solvent as sample solutions
      - method: same solvents and reagents
      - sample: tries to approximate the sample matrix, everything but analyte
  - detection limit:
    - noise: random fluctuations in measured signal
    - blank: a constant (like control) signal measured in absence of analyte
    - limit of detection (LOD): smallest concentration of absolute amount of analyte with signal much larger than blank
    - signal LOD: units as signal (instrument maker) $$S_{mb} + z\sigma_{mb}$$
      - means average blank signal plus 3 standard deviations of blank signal
    - sample LOD: amount/concentration (user)
  - limit of quantitation $$\frac{S}{N} = 10$$: ability to report the concentration
  - calibration curve: $$\sigma_{DL} = 3 \sigma_{mb} /m$$
    - three standard deviations divided by the slope
      - same approach applied to LOQ
*** lecture 3
[[../../../../images/211/LOD_211_Week2_Tuesday.jpeg]]
- controls:
  - positive: standard sample with known quantity of analyte
    - prevents situation when there should be a signal but there is no signal (false negative)
  - negative: standard sample with no analyete
    - prevents situation when there should be no signal and there is a signal (false positive)
- figures of merit
  - LOD, LOQ
  - accuracy & precision
    - error and replicates:
      - absolute: $$\bar{x} - \mu$$
      - relative: $$\frac{\bar{x} - \mu}{\mu} \times 100 \%$$
    - replicate: samples from same source
  - selectivity
    - extent that other substances interfere with determination of analyte
      - interference: chemical that causes systematic error in measured quantity
      - masking agent: prevents components in sample matrix from interfering with analysis
  - sensitivity
    - ability of method to measure small changes in concentration of analyte
  - range: acceptable linearity, accuracy, precision
    - dynamic range: range an instrument can read (measurable response but maybe not linear)
    - linear range: analyte concentration over which response is proportional to concentration
  - robustness
    - ability of method to withstand small, uncontrolled changes in operation parameters
- why FOM: demonstrate validity of method by reporting these parameters
- uncertainty and bias:
  - random uncertainty: can't replicate, contributes to imprecision, quantify with stats
  - systematic uncertainty: contribute to inaccuracy, repeatable, can correct for it in principle
  - types:
    - proportional: %, issue for large signals
    - constant: always some absolute value, issue for small signals
- calibration curves:
  - external calibration in the lab: series of solutions of known concentration of analyte
- concentration detection limit: lowest concentration of analyte in sample that can be detected
  - you can find concentration LOD: $$[C]_{DL} = \frac{3\sigma_{mb}}{m}$$
- matrix effects: combined effect of non-analyte components in sample on measurement of analyte
  - calibration standards should approximate analytical samples in analyte and in composition of non-analyte species
  - matrix too complex, so use standard addition
- standard addition:
  - wet lab: prepare standard solutions but with sample and add analyte to "sample"
  - find x-intercept: when y = 0, this is the "original" value of x (without the shift in y axis)
  - the linear line has been "shifted" on the y axis
    [[../../../../images/211/standard_addition.jpeg]]
*** lecture 4
- internal standard: intentionally add substance that is not expected to be found in sample (not the analyte) but behaves similarly
  - constant amount of internal standard, constant IS signal
  - changing concentrations of analyte
  - plot ratio between analyte and internal standard vs. ratio of their concentrations $$\frac{S_{A}}{S_{IS}}$$ vs. $$\frac{[A]}{[IS]}$$
- calibration curve:
  1. single point calibration (one standard) and the origin
  2. multi-point calibration (4-6)
     - effect of systematic error in any one standard solution minimized by existence of other standards
| external standards                                            | standard addition                                   | internal standards                                                            |
| create standard solutions with varying/known conc. of analyte | add known quantities of analyte to unknown solution | add known amount of different (but similar) compound to unknown and standards |
| interpolate unknown from CC                                   | extrapolate unknown from CC                         | ration of signal from analyte to signal from internal standard                |

- sig figs:
  - pH: pH of 2.45, digits after decimal are how many sig figs the conc. has
  - exact number has infinite number of sig figs
*** Analytical Measurements and Statistics - Gaussian Distribution, Standard Deviation
- gaussian distribution: bell curve
  - 1sd: 68%
  - 2sd: 95%
  - 3sd: 99%
- population vs. sample:
  - sample sd approaches population sd as N > 20
  - as N increases, sd decreases
- propagation of uncertainty:
  - addition/sub: $$\sqrt{\sigma^2_a + \sigma^2_b}$$
  - mult/div: RSD used
*** Analytical Measurements and Statistics - Significance Testing
- significance testing: is difference between two values too large to be explained by random uncertainty
| case 1 t-test           | case 2 t test               | case 3 t-test       | grubb's test |
| compare experi. to true | compare two experi. results | compare two methods | outlier?     |
- null hypothesis: no effect
- choose CI before you do experiments
  - CI: probability a difference exists when it doesn't
- student's t value: permits use of sample data to test hypothesis without knowing population sd

*** lecture 5
- t-statistic (case 1): validation, where there is a known or true value
- t-statistic (case 2, same sd): comparing 2 means, is there enough statistical overlap
- t-statistic (case 2, different sd): use F-test
- t-statistic (case 3): paired/matched data
  - comparing single measurements made with two methods on several different samples
  - before and after (drug trials, same people)
- grubb's test: determine outlier, make sure to remove if it is an outlier
- equilibrium constant
- activity
- weak acid and weak base
- polyprotic acid
  - formulas:
    - $$[H^+] = \sqrt{\frac{K_{a2}[HA^-] + K_w}{1 + \frac{[HA^-]}{K_{a1}}}}$$
    - $$[H^+] = \sqrt{K_{a2}K_{a1}}$$
    - $$pH = 1/2(pK_{a1} + pK_{a2})$$ this is also how you get isoelectric point
- amphiprotic substance

** Equilibrium and volumetric analysis
*** Chemical Equilibrium Applied to Analytical Measurements
*** lecture 6
- systematic treatment of equilibria
  - as many equations as unknowns
    - chemical equilibrium constant expressions
    - charge balance charge on cation_1[cation_1] + charge on cation_2[cation_2] = charge on anion_1[anion_1] + charge on anion_2[anion_2]
    - mass balance (many)
    - formal: moles of original chemical formula in solution, without regard for species that already exist
- alpha diagrams: can plot alpha as a function of pH
*** Solution Equilibrium and Systematic Treatment of Chemical Equilibrium
*** lecture 7
- complexing agent: increases solubility of precipiate
- complex formation: adding excess of B doesn't always precipiate max amount of A (you can have multiple species of complex)
- titrant: solution of known composition and concentration
- titrand: unknown solution
- titrations:
  - acid-base
  - complexometric titrations (metal-ligand)
  - precipiatation (want ppt)
  - redox (titrant is an oxidizing or reducing agent)
- acid-base titrations
  - strong acid: eq point always at 7
  - weak acid: half eq point = $$pK_{a}$$
  - Henderson-Hasselbalch Equation: $$pH = pK_a + log \frac{[A^-]}{[HA]}$$
  - diprotic acid with strong base (how to calculate pH throughout the titration process): (REVIEW)
    - buffer region: H-H equation
    - compare $K_a$s
  - endpoints for polyprotic species:
    - if $$\frac{K_{a,1}}{K_{a,2}}$$ larger than or equal $$10^{4}$$, 1st endpoint will be clear (endpoint can disappear into the other)
    - if $$pK_{a,2}$$ less than or equal 8, 2nd endpoint will be clear (if larger than 8, then $$K_{a2}$$ too weak)
    - triprotic: third endpoint around 12.7, too small, can't see
- buffers
  - effective range: $$pK_a +- 1$$
- acid-base indicator effective within the same range, but in practice is 0.5
  - color transition
*** Polyprotic Acid Equilibria, Polyprotic Acid-Base Titrations
*** lecture 8
- indicators: are actually acids and bases
  - range $P_{ka}$ plus or minus 1, in practice 0.5
- how to ensure we see the change of color in indicator?
  - strong acid: eq point occurs at 7, very steep, the steep portion is almost vertical
  - weak acid: $P_{ka}$ of indicator much larger than $P_{ka}$ of weak acid, or indicator changes color too early because not as steep (?), since eq point occurs after pH 7
  - weak base: eq point occurs before 7
- gravimetric methods
  - obtain analyte by precipitating it
- precipitation titration
  - titrant: $$AgNO_{3}$$
  - argentometric titrations:
    - free $[Ag^+]$ decreases with small value of $K_{sp}$
      - small $K_{sp}$ means bigger number in demoninator (more ppt), pAg is larger
    - for titrating: anything that is insoluble when reacted with  silver
      - endpoint: can be measuring removed or excess
        fluorescein:
        - titration of halides
        - before: colloidal AgX is neg
        - after: colloidal AgX is pos
        - it depends on the ratio between $Ag^+$ and $X^-$ which determines its charge
        - titration graph: after eq point, all indicators converge to the same behaviour
        - "colloid is a mixture in which one substance consisting of microscopically dispersed insoluble particles is suspended throughout another substance"
- EDTA titration
  - how to deal with EDTA titrations at other pH:
    - $$\alpha_6 = \frac{[Y^{4-}]}{C_{EDTA}}$$
    - from $$M^{n+} + Y^{4-} \Leftrightarrow MY^{(n-4)+}$$, we get $$K_f = \frac{[MY^{(n-4)+}]}{[M^{n+}] \alpha_6 c_{EDTA}}$$
  - complexing agent: EDTA at basic pH
  - for titrating: metal
  - pH dependence: as pH increases, amount of unbound metal decreases
    - auxiliary complexing agent: ammonia to complex cations and maintain solubility at basic pH
      - ACA needs larger binding constant than EDTA but smaller formation constant
      - why need basic pH? because many metals precipitate as hydroxoides if pH is too high
      - concentration of $$Y^{-4}$$ is the most at basic pH (it is pH dependent)
        - to use a lower pH: need $$\alpha_6$$, defines mole fraction of $$Y^{-4}$$ at given pH
          - rewrite MY formation to use $$\alpha_6 c_{EDTA} = [Y^{-4}]$$
            - this gives a conditional formation constant: $$K^'_f (pH) = \alpha_6 K_f$$
        - too much ACA decreases sharpness of endpoint
          $$M^{2+} + 4NH_3 \Leftrightarrow Zn(NH_3)_4^{2+}$$
          $$Zn(NH_3)_4^{2+} + Y^{4-} \Leftrightarrow ZnY^{2-} + 4NH_3$$
*** Complexation Equilibria - Quantitative EDTA Titrations
*** lecture 9
- indicators for EDTA:
  - Eriochrome Black T: only works on some metals, can use backtitration to use with other metals
    - orange to red/violet
- complex titrations
  - add masking agents to hide certain metals, needs to have stronger $$K_f$$ than EDTA
  - demasking agent: another metal that binds with masking agent
  - auxillary complexing agent: keep metal in solution
- indirect titration
  - if titration is slow
  - no suitible indicator
  - no useful direct titration reaction
    - you can add A + B, with B in known excess
      - measure leftover B with C
  - applications: volhard titration
    - titrant: $SCN^-$
    - determine: $Ag^+$
    - find out how much halide
    - indicator: $Fe^{+3}$
    - need to ensure $K_f_{AgSCN} > K_f_{FeSCN}$
    - back titration for halide determination
      - titrate with halide solution with excess Ag
        - when all the Cl has been bound, you have Ag in excess
        - start titrating the excess Ag with Fe. You add SCN until the solution turns red -> endpoint
      - SCN^- turns red at first instance of excess SCN^- by reacting with iron
    - displacement titrations
      - want to analyse a metal with EDTA, but if the matrix is unknown, other metals may bind to EDTA that is not the metal of interest
      - instead, react $$Ca^{2+}$$ with $$MgY^+$$; $$Ca^{2+}$$ has higher $K_f$ will displace $$Mg^{2+}$$
        - titrate the freed $$Mg^{2+}$$ in solution ? we titrate the excess Mg with EDTA?

** Electrochemistry and Potentiometry
*** Fundamentals of Electrochemistry
*** lecture 10/11
- what is electrochemistry: electrical measurements of chemical systems
  - inexpensive equipment, can measure complex samples with little sample prep
- reducing/oxidizing:
  - reducing agent: is oxidized, so ON increases, and electrons are lost
  - oxidizing agent: is reduced, so ON decreases, and electrons are gained
- cell types
  - galvanic cell
    - the opposite of electrolytic cell
      - electrons spontaneously go towards positive charge
      - anode (-): electrons leave, so oxidation occurs
      - cathode (+): electrons arrive, reduction occurs
  - electrolytic cell
    - requires electricity
    - electrical energy into chemical energy
    - cell potential is negative
- salt bridge
  - ensures the solution stays neutral
  - completes circuit
  - need ions with the same hydrated size so that they move at the same rate
  - don't want direct mixing of reduction/oxidation
- potential
  - galvanic: initally positive (electrons want to move from anode to cathode)
    - at eq: potential is 0 [Cu$^{2+}$] << 1.00 M << [Zn$^{2+}$]
    - reflects driving force of redex reaction towards eq
  - half-cell and standard potentials:
    - combo of standard half-cells determine overall cell potential
      - $V_1 < V_2$
        - $V_1$: weak oxidizing agent, less easily reduced
        - $V_2$: stronger oxidizing agent, more easily reduced
      - standard reduction potential: E$_{cell}$ = E$_{cathode}$ - E$_{anode}$
        - $$E^\deg$$ is tabulated for reduction reactions, positive if spontaneous relative to SHE
          - SHE is not easy to work with, use other standards like SCE
- ions in solution: concentration vs activity
  - ions interact electrostatically
  - can interact with other things in solution that have charge
  - other ions can partially shield the ions of interest (like Ca$^2+$ and SO$_4^{2-}$)
    - this means $K_{sp}$ gets larger with more salt added (NaCl also partially sheild), takes more CaSO4 to dissolve in water as you add more NaCl -> activity
**** activity
- value of concentration equilibrium constants increase at high electrolyte concentration
  - what does this mean chemically: there is more of the ion product in solution
  - concentration equilibrium constants don't consider other dissolved ions and their electrostatic interations and ion-ion interactions
    - solubility increases???
- activity coefficients: $$a_i = \gamma_i c$$
  - decrease as ionic strength increases
  - thermodynamic eq constant is written in terms of activities
- can ignore for very dilute solutions
**** ionic strength
- the net effect of dissolved electrolytes: $$\mu = \frac{1}{2} \Sigma_i c_i z^2_i$$
  - $$\mu \propto c_i, z_i$$
    - monovalent < divalent < trivalent
      - thus for monovalent salts, ionic strength equals molarity
      - for other salts, ionic strength > molarity
**** activity in dilute solutions
- for neutral molecules, activity coefficient is 1
- for ions: use the debye-huckel limiting law (useful for when ionic strength is less than 0.005 M at 25 C):
  $$log \gamma_i = -0.51 z^2_i \sqrt{\mu}$$
- extended: requires temperature dependent coefficients and effective diameter of hydrated ion
**** free energy and potential
- $$\Delta G = -nFE$$, where E is potential difference, F is Faraday constant, n is unit charges per molecule
  - maxiumum work extracted assuming no heat loss
- we get the Nerst equation by combining the above equation with gibbs equation:
  $$-nFE = -nFE^{\circ} + RT \ln Q \\
  E = E^\circ - \frac{RT}{nF} \ln Q$$
  - when $$K = Q$$, cell potential is 0 and there is no driving force
    - use Nerst equation to find potential at non-standard conditions, replace Q to get:
      $$E = E^\circ - \frac{RT}{nF} \ln \frac{\gamma_C^c [C]^c\gamma_D^d[D]^d}{\gamma_A^a[A]^a \gamma_B^b[B]^b}$$
- can us Nerst on half and full reactions (for half, if there is solid reactant or product, just least as 1)

** introduction to statistics
- assumption: data randomly distributed in normal (gaussian) distribution
- estimation of precision: standard deviation
- outlier: Grubb's test
- comparing two standard deviations: F test
- comparing two means: Student's t-test
- statistics of repeated measurements:
  - absolute uncertainty: uncertainty described directly in the units of measurement
    - absolute error: uncertainty from instrument or equipment
    - reproducible and source of origin known
  - relative uncertainty: percentage of magnitude of quantity measured
    - no units, expressed as percentage
- mean, sd, confidence limits
  - sd: random scatter (s)
  - relative sd: $$\frac{s}{\bar{x}} \times 100\%$$
  - confidence limits: range that you are confident that true value falls
    - number of sds that must be used for different confidence levels is student's t value $$\bar{x}\pm\frac{ts}{\sqrt{N}}$$
    - table t value: requires confidence level (95%) and degrees of freedom (N - 1) where N is number of measurements
- propagation of uncertainty (where $y$ is the answer after doing these operations)
  - addition/subtraction: $$e_y = \sqrt{\sum_{n=1}^N e^2_{x_n}}$$
  - multiplication/division: $$e_y = y\sqrt{\sum_{n=1}^N (\frac{e_{x_n}}{x_n})^2}$$
  - $$y = log(x)$$: $$e_y =  \frac{1}{ln(10)}\frac{e_x}{x}$$
  - $$y = ln(x)$$: $$e_y = \frac{e_x}{x}$$
  - powers of 10 raised to $x$: $$e_y = y ln(10) e_x$$
  - powers of e raised to $x$:  $$e_y = y e_x$$
- sig figs and presenting results:
  1. uncertainty of measurement is larger than instrument's uncertainty
     - sd determines uncertainty of measurement
     - if uncertainty is larger than instrument's uncertainty, the first non zero digit of sd is last sig dig in mean
     - report as $$0.xyz_l \pm 0.00s_d$$
     - sd is reported as one digit, the decimal places of mean and sd must match, record the value after the last sig dig as subscript
  2. uncertainty is smaller than instrument's uncertainty
     - can't use first rule, otherwise reported uncertainty (sd) is lower than instrument uncertainty which cannot be true
     - report answer to same number of digits as instrument's readout
- statistics of linear regression analysis
  1. calibration curve analysis (pure compound dissolved in pure water):
     - prepare series of standard solutions containing known concentration of analyte -> measure property of substance -> plot calibration curve
       - goodness of fit: correlation coefficient $$R^2$$
       - once CC established, unknown solutions can be measured and concentration calculated from: $$C = \frac{(A-b)}{m}$$ where C is concentration, A is measured property, b is y-intercept, m is slope
     - measure of precision is sd: sd of result must be calculated taking into account precision of the calibration curve $$s_x$$
       - depends on sd of slope, regression
       - number of values measured for CC
       - number of times the sample was measured
       - square of distance of unknown measurement from center of calibration curve $$(\bar{y_k}-\bar{y})^2$$
         - closer the measurement is made to the ends of calibration curve, the larger the deviation
     - confidence limits for values $$CL = x \pm t \dot s_x$$
       - $t$ value taken at desired confidence level and $(N-2)$ degrees of freedom (because need two points to specify a line)
     - beer's law
       - spectrophotometric analysis: theory -> light of wavelength $$\lambda$$ and power $$P_o$$/intensity $$I_o$$ enters a sample that absorbs that wavelength, sample molecules raised to excited state and exiting $$P$$ of light will be less. $$T = \frac{I}{I_o} = \frac{P}{P_o)}$$
       - measure of $$I_o$$ with no sample present, then measure $$I$$ with sample present: $$A = mC + b$$
       - transmittance vs. concentration is a exponentially decreasing, so $$A = -log T$$
         - absorbance is directly proportional to concentration of light-absorbing substance: $$A = abC = \epsilon bC$$, b is path length, A is absorbance, C is concentration, a is proportionality constant called absorptivity
           - linear calibration plot
       - plot absorbance vs. concentration to get ab or $$\epsilon b$$ (will be linear)
  2. standard addition analysis
     - complex samples
       - matrix effect can be minimized in two ways:
         1. add standard solution so same substances as unknown sample (same matrix in all solutions)
         2. prepare standard solutions from sample rather than pure analyte and pure solvent
            1. measure property of unknown solution
            2. add known amount of analyte to sample and measure again
               - if $$vol_{sample} >> vol_{analyte}$$, will have around same matrix
       - or pipetting equal volumes of unknown solution into vol. flask and adding known amount of analyte to one, diluting both
         - spiking, and matrix stays the same for both (standard addition method)
         - absorbance vs. concentration of spike:
** glassware
pipette
- TD: pipette is accurately calibrated to deliver specified volume of liquid
  - delivers a specific volume, but holds more
- TC: pipette contains specified volume of liquid with no remainders
  - contain a specific volume
