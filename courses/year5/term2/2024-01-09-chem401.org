** 1: introduction
- basic spectroscopy: light source -> sample -> prism -> detector
  - act of separating light
- history of spectroscopy:
  - 1666 Newton: continuous spectrum of sun
  - 1814 Fraunhofer: found sharp dark lines in sunlight (discrete -> indicts QM)
  - 1900: development of QM
- interstellar molecules (unstable)
- our universe:
  - molecular clouds:
    - very cold: 10 - 100 K
    - not dense: $$\frac{10^{3}}{cm^3}$$
      - this means not many collisions happening, so very unstable molecules can exist <- spectroscopic observation plays important role
  - atmosphere:
    - hot: 300 K
    - dense: $$\frac{10^{20}}{cm^3}$$
- spectroscopy hydrogen atom: chief experimental basis for theories and structure of matter
  - first spectra before QM: Angstrom and Rydberg
  - spectra with QM: Bohr
    - de Broglie: duality of matter
      $$\lambda = \frac{h}{p}$$
      $$E = h\nu$$
    - Schrodinger
  - relativistic quantum theory:
    - Dirac: combine Schrodinger and Einstein
      - $$E = ih \frac{\partial}{\partial \tau}$$
    - Einstein: relativity (things moving at speed of light)
- splitting of hydrogen: bohr -> dirac -> qed

** 2: WebMO practice
- dihedral angle: rotate relative to a plane
- linear molecule: 2 rotational constants
- non-linear molecule: 3 rotational constants
- first optimize then calculate vibrational frequency
** 3: intro to QM
*** electromagnetic radiation
*** molecular processes
*** polarization of light
*** polarization of light
*** linear and circular electric field
*** speed of light
*** reflection and refraction
- law of reflection
- Snell's law
*** polarization and reflection
- s-wave
- p-wave
- reflectivity
  - reflectance (no absorbtion)
  - transmittance
  - Fresnel equation
- brewster angle: angle for 100% energy (to do what??)
- dispersion
  - sellmeier equation
- absorption and refractive index
  - kramers-kronig relations
  - relation with refractive index and light
- birefrigence
** 4: intro to EMR
** 5: light-matter interaction
- radiation density
** 6: prep for final presentation
** 7: intro to molecular rotation and vibration
** 8: molecular symmetry and group theory 1
- operators:
  - $$\hat{E}$$ is identity operator
** 9: molecular symmetry and group theory 2
- group theory and quantum mechanics
  - point symmetry operator R
    - representation of R based on point in 3D space: real orthogonal $$3 \times 3$$ rep M = $$\Gamma(R)$$
    - symmetry operations as operators on space of wavefunctions
      - generalization of symmetry on arbitrary point:
        $$r = M r = \begin{bmatrix}
           x^, \\
           y^, \\
           z^,
         \end{bmatrix}$$
      - we can define the operator $$\hat{P}_R$$ by
        - $$\hat{P}_R|\psi \rangle = \hat{P}_R|\psi(x, y, z) \rangle = |\psi(M^{-1} r) \rangle = |\psi(x^,, y^,, z^,,) \rangle$$
      - interested in finite dimensional subspace of Hilbert space (5D space spanned by $3d$ orbitals): basis set is set of solutions of Schrodinger equation, eigenfunctions of $$\hat{H}$$
- symmetrization
  - projection operator $$\hat{P^{\mu}}$$: annihilates all functions that does not belong to $$\mu$$-th irreducible representation
