* lectures
** 1: introduction
- basic spectroscopy: light source -> sample -> prism -> detector
  - act of separating light
- history of spectroscopy:
  - 1666 Newton: continuous spectrum of sun
  - 1814 Fraunhofer: found sharp dark lines in sunlight (discrete -> indicts QM)
  - 1900: development of QM
- interstellar molecules (unstable)
- our universe:
  - molecular clouds:
    - very cold: 10 - 100 K
    - not dense: $$\frac{10^{3}}{cm^3}$$
      - this means not many collisions happening, so very unstable molecules can exist <- spectroscopic observation plays important role
  - atmosphere:
    - hot: 300 K
    - dense: $$\frac{10^{20}}{cm^3}$$
- spectroscopy hydrogen atom: chief experimental basis for theories and structure of matter
  - first spectra before QM: Angstrom and Rydberg
  - spectra with QM: Bohr
    - de Broglie: duality of matter
      $$\lambda = \frac{h}{p}$$
      $$E = h\nu$$
    - Schrodinger
  - relativistic quantum theory:
    - Dirac: combine Schrodinger and Einstein
      - $$E = ih \frac{\partial}{\partial \tau}$$
    - Einstein: relativity (things moving at speed of light)
- splitting of hydrogen: bohr -> dirac -> qed

** 2: WebMO practice
- dihedral angle: rotate relative to a plane
- linear molecule: 2 rotational constants
- non-linear molecule: 3 rotational constants
- first optimize then calculate vibrational frequency
** 3: intro to QM
** 4: intro to EMR
** 5: light-matter interaction
** 6: prep for final presentation
** 7: intro to molecular rotation and vibration
** 8: molecular symmetry and group theory 1
** 9: molecular symmetry and group theory 2
** 10: molecular rotation and spin statistics 1
** 11: molecular rotation and spin statistics 2
** 12: molecular vibration
** 13: vibrational infrared and raman spectroscopy
** 14: electronic spectroscopy
** 15: electronic spectroscopy
** 16: magnetic resonance
** 17: spectroscopy
** 18 - 25: final presentations
