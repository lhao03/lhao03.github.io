** 1: introduction
- basic spectroscopy: light source -> sample -> prism -> detector
  - act of separating light
- history of spectroscopy:
  - 1666 Newton: continuous spectrum of sun
  - 1814 Fraunhofer: found sharp dark lines in sunlight (discrete -> indicts QM)
  - 1900: development of QM
- interstellar molecules (unstable)
- our universe:
  - molecular clouds:
    - very cold: 10 - 100 K
    - not dense: $$\frac{10^{3}}{cm^3}$$
      - this means not many collisions happening, so very unstable molecules can exist <- spectroscopic observation plays important role
  - atmosphere:
    - hot: 300 K
    - dense: $$\frac{10^{20}}{cm^3}$$
- spectroscopy hydrogen atom: chief experimental basis for theories and structure of matter
  - first spectra before QM: Angstrom and Rydberg
  - spectra with QM: Bohr
    - de Broglie: duality of matter
      $$\lambda = \frac{h}{p}$$
      $$E = h\nu$$
    - Schrodinger
  - relativistic quantum theory:
    - Dirac: combine Schrodinger and Einstein
      - $$E = ih \frac{\partial}{\partial \tau}$$
    - Einstein: relativity (things moving at speed of light)
- splitting of hydrogen: bohr -> dirac -> qed
  [[../../../../images/401/spliitng.jpeg]]
** 2: WebMO practice
- dihedral angle: rotate relative to a plane
- linear molecule: 2 rotational constants
- non-linear molecule: 3 rotational constants
- first optimize then calculate vibrational frequency
** 3: intro to QM
** 4: intro to EMR
*** electromagnetic radiation
- electric (\vv{E}) and magentic (\vv{B}) fields pervade all space; they are vectors with three components (x, y, z)
- in vacuum, speed of light is $$2.998 \times 10^8$$ m/s
- general form: $$E(r, t) = E_0 cps (wt - k \ dot r)$$
  - where $E_0$ is the amplitude vector, k is propagation vector, with r being vector containing x, y, z
- planck relation: $$E = hv = \hbar w = \frac{hc}{\lambda}$$
- 1 eV $$= 1.602 \times 10^{-19}$$ J $$= 8065.54$$ cm $^{-1}$
**** fields (EMR fields)
- 6 fields that are related by these two equations:
  $$ \vv{D} = \epsilon \vv{E} = \epsilon_0 \vv{E} + \vv{P}$$
  $$ \vv{B} = \epsilon \vv{E} = \mu_0 \vv{H} + \vv{M}$$
- $$\vv{E}$$ and $$\vv{H}$$ (electric and magnetic field) are perpendicular to each other and the propagation vector $$\vv{k}$$
  - $$H_0 = \sqrt{\frac{\epsilon}{\mu}}E_0$$
**** polarization of light
- light is transverse wave: osciallations of $$\vv{E}$$ and $$\vv{H}$$ are perpendicular to propagation direction
  - $$ k = |\vv{k}| = \frac{2 \pi}{\lambda} = \frac{w}{c}$$
  - still have DOF in plane perpendicular to $$\vv{k}$$, which relates to the polarization of light
    1. unpolarized light: no perferred direction for $$\vv{E}$$, can be any direction perpendicular, is a statistically mixed state
    2. polarized light: the polarization of $$\vv{E}$$ can rotate during oscillation, the angle
       - for light in the z direction: $$(E_{x0} cos(kz -wt), E_{y0}cos(kz-wt+\theta), 0)$$
         1. plane/linearly polarised: $$\theta = 0$$
         2. elliptically polarized light: $$\theta = +/- \frac{\pi}{2}$$, and $$E_{x0} \neq E_{y0}$$ left/right hand
         3. circularly polarized light: $$E_{x0} = E_{y0}$$, L/R
**** angular momentum and light
L/R circularly polarized photons have angular momentum $$+/- \hbar$$
- no $$S_z = 0$$ photons as light must remain transverse (what does this mean)
  - photon is a massless particle, don't actually haves spin
    - have helicity: value of projection of spin operator onto the momentum operator
- unpolarized light: random statistical mixture of L/R
- polarised light: coherent superposition of L/R circularly polarized light
**** propagation of light
- speed of light in vacuo: $$c_0 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\epsilon_0 \mu_0}}$$
- speed of light in medium: $$c_0 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\epsilon \mu}}$$ where $\epsilon$ and $\mu$ are characteristic to the medium
- refractive index: $$n = \frac{c_0}{v} = \sqrt{\frac{\epsilon \mu}{\epsilon_0 \mu_0}} \geq 1$$, where $\mu$ is magnetic permittivity
- for nonmagnetic media: $$n = \sqrt{\frac{\epsilon}{\epsilon_0}} = \sqrt{\epsilon_r}$$, where $$\epsilon_r$$ is the relative electric permittivity
  - dielectric constant: measured by response to static/low frequency electric field
**** reflection and refraction
- frequency (energy) is unchanged from vacuum value when passing through a medium, $v = v_0$, so since $c = c_0 / n$: the wavelength is reduced: $$ \lambda = \lambda_0 / n$$
  - $$E = hv = \frac{c_0 / n}{ \lambda_0 / n}$$
- reflection (specular, meaning mirror like): $$\theta_{inc} = \theta_{refl}$$
- refraction (snells law): $$n_1 sin \theta_{inc} = n_2 sin \theta_{refr}$$
- polarization:
  - determines the reflectivity
  - $R$ is reflectance, $T = 1 - R$ is the transmittance
  - for s and p waves: with $$T = 1 - R$$
  - Fresnel equation
    - $$R_s = |\frac{n_1 cos \theta_i - n_2 cos \theta_t}{n_1 cos \theta_i + n_2 cos \theta_t}|^2$$
    - $$R_p = |\frac{n_1 cos \theta_t - n_2 cos \theta_i}{n_1 cos \theta_t + n_2 cos \theta_i}|^2$$
    - another form:
      - $$R_s = |\frac{sin(\theta_2 - \theta_1)}{sin(\theta_2 + \theta_1)}|^2$$
      - $$R_p = |\frac{tan(\theta_2 - \theta_1)}{tan(\theta_2 + \theta_1)}|^2$$
    - normal incidence: $$\theta_i = \theta_t = 0$$, then $$R = R_s = R_t = (\frac{n_1 - n_2}{n_1 + n_2})^2$$
    - total internal reflection: when $n_1 > n_2$, there is a critical angle, which $R_s, R_t = 1$
      [[../../../../images/401/internalreflect.jpg]]
- brewster's angle: when $$\theta_t + \theta_i = 90^\deg$$ $$R_p \rightarrow 0$$ and $$T_p \rightarrow 1$$, p polarized light will not be reflected, or if the incident light is unpolarized, only $s$ polarized light will reflect, this is how you can produce polarized light
  - $$\theta_B = arctan(n_2/n_1)$$
  - no reflection for p wave
- dispersion
  - sellmeier equation (empirical relation between $n$ and $\lambda$)
    [[../../../../images/401/angles.png]]
- absoption and refractive index
  - normal regions of dispersion separated by regions of anomalous dispersion between different regions of NMR spectrum
  - kramers-kronig index
- birefringence
  - refractive index: depends on angle between polariztion of light and crystal axis
** 5: light-matter interaction
**** radiation density and intensity of light
- let $$\rho$$ be volume density of energy in EM radiation J/m$^3$
- to find contributions at various frequencies $\rho(v)$ is energy density per unit frequency, and $$ \rho = \int_0^\inf p(v) dv$
- intensity of light: $$I = \int_0^\inf I(v) dv$$
- photon flux: number of photons flowing through a unit area per unit time $$F = \frac{I}{(hv)}$$
  - relations: $$I(v) = p(v)c = p(v)(c_0/n)$$
  - $$I(v) = \frac{1}{2} \epsilon_0 E^2_0 c$$, where $E_0$ is the amplitude for electric field osciallations at frequency $v$
**** absorption and emission
- consider a two level system: can have three processes:
  1. absorption
  2. spontaneous emission
  3. stimulated emission
[[../../../../images/401/qm.png]]
- A and B are transition probabilities, $N_1$, $N_2$ are populations
- Einstein's treatment: @ thermal equilibrium, population ratio given by Boltzmann factor, with degeneracies g: $$\frac{N_2}{N_1} = \frac{g_2}{g_1} e^{-hv / kT}$$, where $hv = E_2 - E_1$
- spontaneous decay (no radiation) kinetic rate law: $$\frac{-d N_{2}}{dt} = A_{21}N_{2}$$, $$N_2 (t) = N_2 (0) e^{-A_{21}t}$$, so radiative lifetime of excited state is $$\frac{1}{A_{21}}$$
- with radiation:
  - upward transition: $$W_{12} = N_{1}B_{12} \rho (v)$$
  - downward transition: $$W_{21} = N_2 B_{21} \rho (v) + N_2 A_{21}$$
  - at eq: these two rates must be equal, so we can solve for $$\rho (v)$$ and insert the thermal eq Boltzmann factor and equate to thermal blackbody spectrum:
    - $$\frac{A_{21}}{(g_1/g_2) e^{\frac{hv}{kT}} B_{12} - B_{21}}$$
    - we get $$g_1 B_{12} = g_2 B_{21}$$: equal probability of 1 to 2 or 2 to 1
    - and $$\frac{A_{21}}{B_{21}} = \frac{8 \pi h v^3}{c^3} \propto v^3$$
      - higher frequency: spontaneous emission
      - lower frequency: stimulated emission
**** transition dipole momentum
- transition rate determined by "transition dipole moment"
- transition dipole moment between two states $n$ and $m$ is a vector: $$\mu_{mn} = \int \psi_m^* \hat{\mu} \psi_n dV = \langle m | \hat{mu} | n \rangle $$
  - $$\hat{mu}$$ is the electric dipole moment operator: $$\hat{mu} = \sigma_i q_i r_i$$
- transition rates determined by Einstein coefficients times a lineshape factor resonantly peaked at transition frequency ($$E_2 - E_1$$), enforces energy conservation
**** beer's law
- not covered much, study more later
**** line profiles for spectral lines
- conservation of energy: $$v = v_{12}$$: $$v_{12}$ splittings between eigenvalues
  - $$\delta(v - v_{12})$$
- reality: emission/absoption never perfectly monochromatic (single wavelength/color): each line has characteristic shape/profile, with certain width $\delta v$, quantified as FWHM
- lines spaced apart less than $\delta v$ cannot be seperated/resolved
- common line shape:
  - lorentzian: broadening by the natural lifetime of the excited state
  - guassian: inhomogeneous broadened lines (Doppler broadening)
  - voigt: mixes guassian and lorentzian
    - convolution of two and appropriate when homogeneous and inhomogeneous mechanisms are important
- natural linewidth

** 6: prep for final presentation
** 8: molecular symmetry and group theory 1
- operators:
  - $$\hat{E}$$ is identity operator
** 9: molecular symmetry and group theory 2
- group theory and quantum mechanics
  - point symmetry operator R
    - representation of R based on point in 3D space: real orthogonal $$3 \times 3$$ rep M = $$\Gamma(R)$$
    - symmetry operations as operators on space of wavefunctions
      - generalization of symmetry on arbitrary point:
        $$r = M r = \begin{bmatrix}
           x^, \\
           y^, \\
           z^,
         \end{bmatrix}$$
      - we can define the operator $$\hat{P}_R$$ by
        - $$\hat{P}_R|\psi \rangle = \hat{P}_R|\psi(x, y, z) \rangle = |\psi(M^{-1} r) \rangle = |\psi(x^,, y^,, z^,,) \rangle$$
      - interested in finite dimensional subspace of Hilbert space (5D space spanned by $3d$ orbitals): basis set is set of solutions of Schrodinger equation, eigenfunctions of $$\hat{H}$$
- symmetrization
  - projection operator $$\hat{P^{\mu}}$$: annihilates all functions that does not belong to $$\mu$$-th irreducible representation

*** $$H_2O$$

** 10: molecular rotation and spin statistics 1
*** born-oppenheimer approximation
- fixed nucleus
- total hamiltonian consists of kinetic energy of nucleus, electrons, and coloumb potential energy between nuclei, nuclei-electrons, and electrons
*** (and BO adiabatic approximation)
- wavefunction is product of electron and nuclei $$\Psi_{n,i} = \chi^{(n)}_i (R) \psi^{el}_n(r;R)$$
- for a fixed R  we get the electronic schrodinger equation: $$\hat{H} = \hat{H}_{nuc} + \hat{H}_{elec}$$, where $$\hat{H}_elec = \psi^{el}_n(r;R) = E^{el}_n (R) \psi^{el}_n(r;R)$$
- nuclear schrodinger equation: $$[\hat{H}_{nuc} + E^{el}_n(R)]\chi^{n}_i (R) = E_{n, i \chi^{(n)}_i}(R)$$
     - then by changing the value of R, we get the potential energy surface $$E^{el}_n$$
*** separation of vibration and rotation
- separation of translational motion
  - we can seperate translational motion and internal motion (rotation and vibration) by using $$R_{CM}$$, center of mass
         [[../../../../images/401/rcm.png]]
- $$\hat{T}_{nuc} = - \frac{\hbar^2}{2M} \nabla^2_{CM} - \frac{\hbar^2}{2 \mu} \nabla^2_{int}$$
*** can further seperate vibrational and rotational motion
- using polar coordinates
  - $$\hat{H}_{nuc} + E^{el}_n (R) = \hat{T}_{vib} + E^{el}_n (R) + \frac{1}{2 \mu R^2} \hat{L}^2 (\theta \psi)$$ (last term is $$\hat{H}_{rot})$$
- we get vibration-rotation wavefunction: $$\chi_{n, v, J, M} (R) = S_v^(n) (R) Y_{JM} (\theta \psi)$$ where vibration only depends on bond length and rotation depends on two angles
*** rotation of diatomic molecules
- rigid rotater: if you set $R = R_e$ where $R_e$ is equilibrium bond length, $$\hat{T}_{vib} = 0$$
- spherical harmonics (eigensolution)
- for $$\hat{L}^2 | Y_{Jm}$$, $$\hbar^2 J (J+1)$$ is the eigenvalue
- for $$\hat{L}_z$$, $$\hbar m$$ is the eigenvalue
- moment of interia is simple $$I_e = \mu R^2_e$$
- rotational constant:
  - $$B_e = \frac{\hbar^2}{2 I_e} \text{ (J)}$$
  - $$ = \frac{\hbar^2}{8 \pi^2 I_e} \text{ (Hz)}$$
  - $$ = \frac{\hbar^2}{8 \pi^2 I_e c} \text{ (cm}^{-1})$$
*** polyatomic molecules: linear
- start with moment of inertia tensor:
     $$\begin{bmatrix}
        I_{xx} & I_{xy} & I_{xz} \\
        I_{yx} & I_{yy} & I_{yz} \\
        I_{zx} & I_{zy} & I_{zz} \\
        \end{bmatrix}$$
- diagonalize to get moment of intertia:
     $$\begin{bmatrix}
        I_{aa} & & \\
        & I_{bb} & \\
        & & I_{cc} \\
        \end{bmatrix}$$
- x y z axis don't always correspond to a b c axis
- to calculate:
  - $$I_{xx} = \Sigma m_\alpha (y^2_\alpha + z^2_\alpha)$$
  - $$I_{xy} = - \Sigma m_\alpha x_\alpha y_\alpha$$
- example: [[../../../../images/401/hoh.png]]
  -
  - $$I_{xx} = \Sigma m_\alpha (y^2_\alpha + z^2_\alpha) = M_H(f^2 + g^2) + M_H(f^2 + g^2) + M_O h^2$$
  - $$I_{xy} = - \Sigma m_\alpha x_\alpha y_\alpha = -(M_H fg + M_H f (-g))$$ why no $M_O$
  - $$\begin{bmatrix}
        M_H h^2 + 2M_H (f^2 + g^2) & 0 & 0 \\
        0 & M_O h^2 + 2 M_H g^2 & 0 \\
        0 & 0 & 2M_H f^2 \\
        \end{bmatrix}$$
  - 3 moment of inertia values, 3 rotational constants
    - units of inertia: $\text{amu} \AA^2$
      - $$I_A \leq I_B \leq I_C$$, $$A \geq B \geq C$$
    - rotational constant $=505379.07/I \text{amu} \AA^2$$
- important quantum notes:
  - $I_a = 0$, $I_b = I_c$
  - degeneracies: g = 2J + 1
  - $E_J = BJ(J+1)$
*** polyatomic molecules: symmetric top
- prolate: $I_a < I_b = I_c$, $A > B = C$
- another quantum number: J = 0, 1 2, and K, M = -J, -J+1, ..., J-1, J
  - if K = 0: g = 2J+1
  - if K != 0: g = 2(2J+1)
- $E_{JK} = BJ(J+1) + (A-B)K^2$
[[../../../../images/401/prolate.png]]
- oblate: $I_a = I_b < I_c$, $A = B < C$
- $E_{JK} = BJ(J+1) + (C-B)K^2$
[[../../../../images/401/oblate.png]]
*** polyatomic molecules: spherical top
- $I_a = I_b = I_c$
[[../../../../images/401/sphericaltop.png]]
- $E_J = BJ(J+1)$
- there is still K, $g = (2J + 1)^2$
*** polyatomic molecules: asymmetric top
- $I_a \neq I_b \neq I_c$
[[../../../../images/401/asym.png]]
*** optical selection rule: diatomic and linear
- $\mu_0 \neq 0$ $\Delta J = +/- 1$, $\Delta M = 0, +/-1$
  - can only transition between J and J+1, seperations are 2B.
  - transition frequency: $2B(J+1)$
    - idk waht is mu
*** symmetric and asymmetric top molecules
- symmetric top: $\mu_0 \neq 0$ $\Delta J = +/- 1$, $\Delta M = 0, +/-1$, $\Delta K = 0$
- asymmetric top: $\Delta J = 0, +/- 1$, $\Delta M = 0, +/-1$
  - then more details based on if it is a-type, b-type, c-type transition
