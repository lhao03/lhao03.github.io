** 1: introduction
- basic spectroscopy: light source -> sample -> prism -> detector
  - act of separating light
- history of spectroscopy:
  - 1666 Newton: continuous spectrum of sun
  - 1814 Fraunhofer: found sharp dark lines in sunlight (discrete -> indicts QM)
  - 1900: development of QM
- interstellar molecules (unstable)
- our universe:
  - molecular clouds:
    - very cold: 10 - 100 K
    - not dense: $$\frac{10^{3}}{cm^3}$$
      - this means not many collisions happening, so very unstable molecules can exist <- spectroscopic observation plays important role
  - atmosphere:
    - hot: 300 K
    - dense: $$\frac{10^{20}}{cm^3}$$
- spectroscopy hydrogen atom: chief experimental basis for theories and structure of matter
  - first spectra before QM: Angstrom and Rydberg
  - spectra with QM: Bohr
    - de Broglie: duality of matter
      $$\lambda = \frac{h}{p}$$
      $$E = h\nu$$
    - Schrodinger
  - relativistic quantum theory:
    - Dirac: combine Schrodinger and Einstein
      - $$E = ih \frac{\partial}{\partial \tau}$$
    - Einstein: relativity (things moving at speed of light)
- splitting of hydrogen: bohr -> dirac -> qed

** 2: WebMO practice
- dihedral angle: rotate relative to a plane
- linear molecule: 2 rotational constants
- non-linear molecule: 3 rotational constants
- first optimize then calculate vibrational frequency
** 3: intro to QM
** 4: intro to EMR
*** electromagnetic radiation
- electric (\vv{E}) and magentic (\vv{B}) fields pervade all space; they are vectors with three components (x, y, z)
- in vacuum, speed of light is $$2.998 \times 10^8$$ m/s
- general form: $$E(r, t) = E_0 cps (wt - k \ dot r)$$
  - where $E_0$ is the amplitude vector, k is propagation vector, with r being vector containing x, y, z
- planck relation: $$E = hv = \hbarw = \frac{hc}{\lambda}$$
- 1 eV $$= 1.602 \times 10^{-19}$$ J $$= 8065.54$$ cm $^{-1}$
**** fields (EMR fields)
- 6 fields that are related by these two equations:
  $$ \vv{D} = \epsilon \vv{E} = \epsilon_0 \vv{E} + \vv{P}$$
  $$ \vv{B} = \epsilon \vv{E} = \mu_0 \vv{H} + \vv{M}$$
- $$\vv{E}$$ and $$\vv{H}$$ (electric and magnetic field) are perpendicular to each other and the propagation vector $$\vv{k}$$
  - $$H_0 = \sqrt{\frac{\epsilon}{\mu}}E_0$$
**** polarization of light
- light is transverse wave: osciallations of $$\vv{E}$$ and $$\vv{H}$$ are perpendicular to propagation direction
  - $$ k = |\vv{k}| = \frac{2 \pi}{\lambda} = \frac{w}{c}$$
  - still have DOF in plane perpendicular to $$\vv{k}$$, which relates to the polarization of light
    1. unpolarized light: no perferred direction for $$\vv{E}$$, can be any direction perpendicular, is a statistically mixed state
    2. polarized light: the polarization of $$\vv{E}$$ can rotate during oscillation, the angle
       - for light in the z direction: $$(E_{x0} cos(kz -wt), E_{y0}cos(kz-wt+\theta), 0)$$
         1. plane/linearly polarised: $$\theta = 0$$
         2. elliptically polarized light: $$\theta = +/- \frac{\pi}{2}$$, and $$E_{x0} \neq E_{y0}$$ left/right hand
         3. circularly polarized light: $$E_{x0} = E_{y0}$$, L/R
**** angular momentum and light
L/R circularly polarized photons have angular momentum $$+/- \hbar$$
- no $$S_z = 0$$ photons as light must remain transverse (what does this mean)
  - photon is a massless particle, don't actually haves spin
    - have helicity: value of projection of spin operator onto the momentum operator
- unpolarized light: random statistical mixture of L/R
- polarised light: coherent superposition of L/R circularly polarized light
**** propagation of light
- speed of light in vacuo: $$c_0 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\epsilon_0 \mu_0}}$$
- speed of light in medium: $$c_0 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\epsilon \mu}}$$ where $\epsilon$ and $\mu$ are characteristic to the medium
- refractive index: $$n = \frac{c_0}{v} = \sqrt{\frac{\epsilon \mu}{\epsilon_0 \mu_0}} \geq 1$$, where $\mu$ is magnetic permittivity
- for nonmagnetic media: $$n = \sqrt{\frac{\epsilon}{\epsilon_0}} = \sqrt{\epsilon_r}$$, where $$\epsilon_r$$ is the relative electric permittivity
  - dielectric constant: measured by response to static/low frequency electric field
**** reflection and refraction
- frequency (energy) is unchanged from vacuum value when passing through a medium, $v = v_0$, so since $c = c_0 / n$: the wavelength is reduced: $ \lambda = \lambda_0 / n$$
  - $$E = hv = \frac{c_0 / n}{ \lambda_0 / n}$$
- reflection (specular, meaning mirror like): $$\theta_{inc} = \theta_{refl}$$
- refraction (snells law): $$n_1 sin \theta_{inc} = n_2 sin \theta_{refr}$$
- polarization:
  - determines the reflectivity
  - $R$ is reflectance, $T = 1 - R$ is the transmittance
  - for s and p waves: with $$T = 1 - R$$
  - Fresnel equation
    - $$R_s = |\frac{n_1 cos \theta_i - n_2 cos \theta_t}{n_1 cos \theta_i + n_2 cos \theta_t}|^2$$
    - $$R_t = |\frac{n_1 cos \theta_t - n_2 cos \theta_i}{n_1 cos \theta_t + n_2 cos \theta_i}|^2$$
      - normal incidence: $$\theta_i = \theta_t = 0$$, then $$R = R_s = R_t = (\frac{n_1 - n_2}{n_1 + n_2})^2$$
    - total internal reflection: when $n_1 > n_2$, there is a critical angle, which $R_s, R_t = 1$
      [[../../../../images/401/internalreflect.jpg]]
- brewster's angle: when $$\theta_t + \theta_i = 90^\deg$$ $R_p \rightarrow 0$$ and $$T_p \rightarrow 1$$, p polarized light will not be reflected, or if the incident light is unpolarized, only $s$ polarized light will reflect, this is how you can produce polarized light
  - $$\theta_B = arctan(n_2/n_1)$$
- dispersion
  - sellmeier equation
**** radiation density and intensity of light
- let $$\rho$$ be volume densitty of energy in EM radiation J/m$^3$
- to find contributions at various frequencies $\rho(v)$ is energy density per unit frequency, and $$ \rho = \int_0^\inf p(v) dv$
- intensity of light: $$I = \int_0^\inf I(v) dv$$
- photon flux: number of photons flowing through a unit area per unit time $$F = \frac{I}{(hv)}$$
  - relations: $$I(v) = p(v)c = p(v)(c_0/n)$$
  - $$I(v) = \frac{1}{2} \epsilon_0 E^2_0 c$$, where $E_0$ is the amplitude for electric field osciallations at frequency $v$

  - $$\hat{E}$$ is identity operator
** 9: molecular symmetry and group theory 2
- group theory and quantum mechanics
  - point symmetry operator R
    - representation of R based on point in 3D space: real orthogonal $$3 \times 3$$ rep M = $$\Gamma(R)$$
    - symmetry operations as operators on space of wavefunctions
      - generalization of symmetry on arbitrary point:
        $$r = M r = \begin{bmatrix}
           x^, \\
           y^, \\
           z^,
         \end{bmatrix}$$
      - we can define the operator $$\hat{P}_R$$ by
        - $$\hat{P}_R|\psi \rangle = \hat{P}_R|\psi(x, y, z) \rangle = |\psi(M^{-1} r) \rangle = |\psi(x^,, y^,, z^,,) \rangle$$
      - interested in finite dimensional subspace of Hilbert space (5D space spanned by $3d$ orbitals): basis set is set of solutions of Schrodinger equation, eigenfunctions of $$\hat{H}$$
- symmetrization
  - projection operator $$\hat{P^{\mu}}$$: annihilates all functions that does not belong to $$\mu$$-th irreducible representation
