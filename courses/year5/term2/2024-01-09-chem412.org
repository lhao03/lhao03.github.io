- slater vs. gaussian
  [[../../../../images/412/svg.png]]
  - gaussian decays too quickly and has longer tails
    - ill behaving because decays too fast
    - near nuclei (at origin), is flat, differential is 0
  - slater is proper function to use
    - not differentiable because of cusp (at origin)
  - predict different behaviour at nuclei (experimentally by EPR)
    - should anticipate some mistakes
- review 6 ways non-differentiability
*** notes on relativistic effects
- special relativity: laws of motion for non-accelerating bodies travelling at speed of light
  - as speed approach 0, special relativity tends towrds eq with newton's laws of motion
- general relativity: laws of motion viewed from accelerating reference frames (geometric explanation for gravity)
- special relativity:
  - postulates
    1. impossible to transmit information faster than speed of light
    2. laws of physics are identical, without any variation, in every location in universe, no matter how fast travelling
  - consequences: time dilation (observer in one reference frame observes clock in another frame to be ticking more slowly than in observer's own frame), length contradiction (same analogy but with length),  and as a body moves with increasing velocity its mass increases: $$t = \gamma t_0, \mathcal{l} = \gamma \mathcal{l}_0, m = \gamma m_0$$
    - this follows $$E = mc^2$$, $$E^2 = p^2c^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$$
- combining relativity and quantum theory
  - energy "uncertainty" (QM) mass-energy equivalence (special relativity) $$\rightarrow$$ particle/anti-particle pairs by quantum fluctuations
  - klein-gordon equation (relativistic version of Schrodinger equation for spin-0 particle) (using time-dependent Schrodinger equation)
    $$\begin{align*}
    E &= \frac{p^2}{2m} \\
    i\hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\psi &= - \frac{h^2}{2m} \nabla \psi \\
    (i\hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t})^2 \psi &= - [(i\hbar \nabla)^2c^2 +m_0^2c^4] \psi \\
    \frac{1}{c^2}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2} \psi - \nabla^2 \psi + \frac{m^2_0c^2}{\hbar^2} \psi &= 0 \\
    \end{align*}$$ this is the d'Alembert operator (???)
- dirac equation:
  - electron is spin 1/2 particle (fermion)
    $$ih\frac{\partial \psi(X, t)}{\partial t} = (c\sum_{k=1}^{3} \alpha_k p_k + \beta mc^2) \psi(x,t)$$ factorized using d'Alembert operator
    $$\psi(x,t) =  \begin{pmatrix}
    \psi_1(x,t) \\
    \psi_2(x,t) \\
    \psi_3(x,t) \\
    \psi_4(x,t) \\
    \end{pmatrix} $$
  - wavefunctions 1/2 are for particle and 3/4 are for antiparticle (each wavefunction is either spin-up or spin-down)
    - we get gamma (dirac) matrices and pauli matrices
** 1
- Taylor expansion $$\rightarrow$$ power series $$a_0 + a_1x + a_2x^2 + etc$$
  - different powers of x form basis set
  - chem312: $$\psi (x) = \sum C_n \psi_n$$
  - minimal basis set is least accurate
- spin multiplicity: 2s+1 (review term symbols)
  - 1 e, s = 1/2
  - 0 single electrons, s = 0, 2s+1 = 1
  - open shell singlet: 1/2, -1/2
  - open shell triplet: 1/2, 1/2
  - closed shell triplet is not possible (Pauli exclusion principle)
- hybridization changes electronegativity
  - https://web.ics.purdue.edu/~loudonm/pdf/Supplement_04.01.pdf
  - $sp$ more electronegative than $sp^2$ more electronegative than $sp^3$
  - this causes dipole moments: arrow goes + to -
  - $sp^2$ has electron in the $2p$ orbital, which the electron density of $2p$ is not evenly distributed around nucleus in all directions [[../../../../images/412/hy.jpeg]]
  - $sp^3$ by contrast, the electron density is evenly distributed in the hybrid orbitals
- geometry sequence energies: tries to find a derivative of 0 to minimize nuclear repulsion energy
  - derivative is indication of force
- basis functions: relate to the orbitals, stay the same for each bond distance the program tries
- molecular energy vs. geometry optimization: ME is more optimized because geometry optimization doesn't take derivative to 0, only closely

$$\hat{H} \Psi = E \Psi$$, where the Hamiltonian $$\hat{H} = \hat{T} + \hat{V}$$
- by substituting classical momentum with its quantum form: $$\hat{T} = -\frac{\hbar ^2}{2m}\nabla^2$$
- potential operator $$\hat{V}$$ if function of position $r$ and time $t$.
  - don't care about gravity because it is too small
  - Coulombic interaction: $$\hat{V} = - \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon} \frac{e^2}{r}$$
- $$| \Psi |^2$$: charge density, gives information about dipole moment and chemical reactivity
- PES: energy, E, an eigenvalue. potential energy surface
  - give you information about stable molecular structures/chemical reactivity

[[../../../../images/412/cvsv.jpeg]]
- special relativity: length contraction, mass increase, time dilation
  - relevant for:
    - spin:
    - pauli exclusion principle
    - spin-orbit coupling
- noone can travel faster than the speed of light: $|v| \leq c$$
  - $$0 \leq \frac{|v|}{c} \leq 1$$
  - lorentz factor: $$\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (\frac{v}{c})^2}}$$
- length contraction:
  - only happens in dimension of velocity
  - the faster the object moves, the shorter the object becomes
  - subjective: depends on how fast the observer is moving
- mass increase:
  - mass in motion becomes more massive
  - at speed of light can't move anymore (so massive)
- time dilation:
  - things that have short half life: live forever when moving at speed of light
- core electrons: more stable
  - s,p orbitals contract in size
    - screen the nuclear charge
    - smaller, lower energy, denser electron cloud
    - move faster??
      - heavier so more kinetic energy?
  - p, d orbitals larger because feel less nuclear charge
- http://alchemy.cchem.berkeley.edu/inorganic/RelativisticEffects.pdf
- fermion: half integer spin
  - even number of fermion is boson, odd number of fermion is fermion
- boson: integer spin

- Pauli Exclusion Principle
- Postulates in QM
  - function must constrain to physical world
  - any observable A, has Hermitian operator $$\hat{A}$$
    - Hermitian operators are self-adjoint
  - time dependent Schrodinger equation
    - we use time independent equation (time is $$e^{-iEt/\hbar}$$)

- potential energy surfaces (PES)
  - a molecule needs 3N coordinates to describe it
    - position (spatial): 3
    - rotations: 3 (2 for linear)
    - (internal degrees of freedom) vibrational: 3N - (3 + 2 or 3)
      - PES is described using these coordinates
- classifications
  - ab initio: from first principles
    - only need electronics $$\hat{H}_e$$: number of electrons and type of nuclei
  - empirical: functions constructed from values by fitting calculated properties to experimental data
    - Lennard-Jones PES: $$V_{LJ}(R) = V_0 [(\frac{R_0}{R})^12-2(\frac{R_0}{R})^6]$$
      - $$V_0$$ and $$R_0$$ are well depth and minimum of potential well respectively; determined from IR
        - functional form: chemical intuition
        - parameters: experimental
    - semi-empirical: mixture
- 412: concerned with ab initio
- larger molecules use empirical potentials
- anatomy of PES
  - attractive state: has a well representing a bond
  - repulsive state: no stable bond, not really a well, like a ball rolling down until reaching dissociation limit
  - $$R \rightarrow 0$$: PESs climb to higher energies because of electron cloud repulsion and then more steeply from nuclear repulsive term
- Gaussian finds $$R_0$$, at the minimum of PES
  - matches experimental structure at low vibrational states
- vibrational analysis
  - approximations based on harmonic oscillator
    - approximated in Taylor series, which we can simplify to parabola
      - matches behaviour at the well, but elsewhere does not
    - approximation has 5-10% difference from experimental values; even with exact PES using the harmonic approximation will lead to errors
- how is this done for a PES of $p$ dimensions:
  1. find stationary point where all first derivatives are 0 (makes taylor series expansion simpler?)
  2. expand PES in multidimensional Taylor series about stationary point keeping only quadratic term (linear terms 0 because of step 1.)
  3. form Hessian matrix, where diagonals are pure second derivative and everything else is mixed second derivative.
  4. diagonalize the Hessian to find new set of coordinates, which are normal modes, $$q_i$$.
     - $$q_i$$ is a linear combination of original $$\{R_i\}$$ coordinates.
5. in normal mode basis, only pure second derivatives remain. mixed second derivative terms are zero; no coupling between different normal modes. each normal mode is independent of others, so the pure second derivative can be used to define a harmonic oscillator
   - $$p$$ normal modes, $$p$$ harmonic oscillators
6. ZPE is sum of harmonic frequencies multiplied by $$\frac{\hbar}{2}$$
