- slater vs. gaussian
  [[../../../../images/412/svg.png]]
  - gaussian decays too quickly and has longer tails
    - ill behaving because decays too fast
    - near nuclei (at origin), is flat, differential is 0
  - slater is proper function to use
    - not differentiable because of cusp (at origin)
  - predict different behaviour at nuclei (experimentally by EPR)
    - should anticipate some mistakes
- review 6 ways non-differentiability
*** notes on relativistic effects
- special relativity: laws of motion for non-accelerating bodies travelling at speed of light
  - as speed approach 0, special relativity tends towrds eq with newton's laws of motion
- general relativity: laws of motion viewed from accelerating reference frames (geometric explanation for gravity)
- special relativity:
  - postulates
    1. impossible to transmit information faster than speed of light
    2. laws of physics are identical, without any variation, in every location in universe, no matter how fast travelling
  - consequences: time dilation (observer in one reference frame observes clock in another frame to be ticking more slowly than in observer's own frame), length contradiction (same analogy but with length),  and as a body moves with increasing velocity its mass increases: $$t = \gamma t_0, \mathcal{l} = \gamma \mathcal{l}_0, m = \gamma m_0$$
    - this follows $$E = mc^2$$, $$E^2 = p^2c^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$$
- combining relativity and quantum theory
  - energy "uncertainty" (QM) mass-energy equivalence (special relativity) $$\rightarrow$$ particle/anti-particle pairs by quantum fluctuations
  - klein-gordon equation (relativistic version of Schrodinger equation for spin-0 particle) (using time-dependent Schrodinger equation)
    $$\begin{align*}
    E &= \frac{p^2}{2m} \\
    i\hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\psi &= - \frac{h^2}{2m} \nabla \psi \\
    (i\hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t})^2 \psi &= - [(i\hbar \nabla)^2c^2 +m_0^2c^4] \psi \\
    \frac{1}{c^2}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2} \psi - \nabla^2 \psi + \frac{m^2_0c^2}{\hbar^2} \psi &= 0 \\
    \end{align*}$$ this is the d'Alembert operator (???)
- dirac equation:
  - electron is spin 1/2 particle (fermion)
    $$ih\frac{\partial \psi(X, t)}{\partial t} = (c\sum_{k=1}^{3} \alpha_k p_k + \beta mc^2) \psi(x,t)$$ factorized using d'Alembert operator
    $$\psi(x,t) =  \begin{pmatrix}
    \psi_1(x,t) \\
    \psi_2(x,t) \\
    \psi_3(x,t) \\
    \psi_4(x,t) \\
    \end{pmatrix} $$
  - wavefunctions 1/2 are for particle and 3/4 are for antiparticle (each wavefunction is either spin-up or spin-down)
    - we get gamma (dirac) matrices and pauli matrices
** 1
- Taylor expansion $$\rightarrow$$ power series $$a_0 + a_1x + a_2x^2 + etc$$
  - different powers of x form basis set
  - chem312: $$\psi (x) = \sum C_n \psi_n$$
  - minimal basis set is least accurate
- spin multiplicity: 2s+1 (review term symbols)
  - 1 e, s = 1/2
  - 0 single electrons, s = 0, 2s+1 = 1
  - open shell singlet: 1/2, -1/2
  - open shell triplet: 1/2, 1/2
  - closed shell triplet is not possible (Pauli exclusion principle)
- hybridization changes electronegativity
  - https://web.ics.purdue.edu/~loudonm/pdf/Supplement_04.01.pdf
  - $sp$ more electronegative than $sp^2$ more electronegative than $sp^3$
  - this causes dipole moments: arrow goes + to -
  - $sp^2$ has electron in the $2p$ orbital, which the electron density of $2p$ is not evenly distributed around nucleus in all directions [[../../../../images/412/hy.jpeg]]
  - $sp^3$ by contrast, the electron density is evenly distributed in the hybrid orbitals
- geometry sequence energies: tries to find a derivative of 0 to minimize nuclear repulsion energy
  - derivative is indication of force
- basis functions: relate to the orbitals, stay the same for each bond distance the program tries
- molecular energy vs. geometry optimization: ME is more optimized because geometry optimization doesn't take derivative to 0, only closely

** 2
$$\hat{H} \Psi = E \Psi$$, where the Hamiltonian $$\hat{H} = \hat{T} + \hat{V}$$
- by substituting classical momentum with its quantum form: $$\hat{T} = -\frac{\hbar ^2}{2m}\nabla^2$$
- potential operator $$\hat{V}$$ if function of position $r$ and time $t$.
  - don't care about gravity because it is too small
  - Coulombic interaction: $$\hat{V} = - \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon} \frac{e^2}{r}$$
- $$| \Psi |^2$$: charge density, gives information about dipole moment and chemical reactivity
- PES: energy, E, an eigenvalue. potential energy surface
  - give you information about stable molecular structures/chemical reactivity

[[../../../../images/412/cvsv.jpeg]]
- special relativity: length contraction, mass increase, time dilation
  - relevant for:
    - spin:
    - pauli exclusion principle
    - spin-orbit coupling
- noone can travel faster than the speed of light: $|v| \leq c$$
  - $$0 \leq \frac{|v|}{c} \leq 1$$
  - lorentz factor: $$\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (\frac{v}{c})^2}}$$
- length contraction:
  - only happens in dimension of velocity
  - the faster the object moves, the shorter the object becomes
  - subjective: depends on how fast the observer is moving
- mass increase:
  - mass in motion becomes more massive
  - at speed of light can't move anymore (so massive)
- time dilation:
  - things that have short half life: live forever when moving at speed of light
- core electrons: more stable
  - s,p orbitals contract in size
    - screen the nuclear charge
    - smaller, lower energy, denser electron cloud
    - move faster??
      - heavier so more kinetic energy?
  - p, d orbitals larger because feel less nuclear charge
- http://alchemy.cchem.berkeley.edu/inorganic/RelativisticEffects.pdf
- fermion: half integer spin
  - even number of fermion is boson, odd number of fermion is fermion
- boson: integer spin

- Pauli Exclusion Principle
- Postulates in QM
  - function must constrain to physical world
  - any observable A, has Hermitian operator $$\hat{A}$$
    - Hermitian operators are self-adjoint
  - time dependent Schrodinger equation
    - we use time independent equation (time is $$e^{-iEt/\hbar}$$)
** 5

- notes from paper and ipad notes summary
*** bonding between 2 different atomic orbitals on 2 different atoms
$$\Psi_{bonding} =
  \begin{pmatrix}
  1 \\
  \alpha_1
\end{pmatrix}$$
$$\Psi_{antibonding} =
  \begin{pmatrix}
  -\alpha_2 \\
  1
\end{pmatrix}$$
- $$\alpha_1 \neq \alpha_2$$: this means the interaction creates to MOs of two different energy differences
  $$\alpha_2 > \alpha_1 > 0$$
  - there is more destabilization vs. stabilization
  - the lower energy atomic orbital is the one that is more electronegative, why? because holds electrons more close to the nucleus, less separation between negative and positive charges
- with $$\epsilon_n = \text{AO energy}$$, when far apart, $$E_1 \rightarrow \epsilon_1$$ and $$\Psi \rightarrow \psi$$
- as the difference between two atomic orbital energies increase, bonding interactions decrease, why? mathematically:
  $$E_1 = \epsilon_1 - \frac{\epsilon_2 - \epsilon_1}{2(1 - S^2_{12})}(\sqrt{1 + 4\alpha_1\alpha_2} - 1 - 2\alpha_1S_{12})$$, so when the difference between $$\epsilon_2 - \epsilon_1$$ is very large, then there is no bonding.
- the chemical result we can get from this is that: AOs close to each other feel bonding interaction and are affected, AOs with different energy levels remain non-interacting
- this is why we only get certain types of mixing/hybridization: the AO energies must be close enough
- atomic orbitals contribute unevenly to MOs: antibonding is destabilized slightly more than stabilized
*** molecular hamiltonian
- hamiltonian is total energy operator
- for a molecule:
  - $N$ nuclei: $$(\alpha = 1,2,3, ..., N)$$ with (mass $$M_\alpha$$, charge $$Z_\alpha_e$$, position $$R_\alpha$$)
  - $n$ electrons: $$(i = 1,2, ..)$$ with (mass $m_e$, charge $$-e$$, position $$r_i$$)
- Hamiltonian $$\hat{H} = \hat{T}_N + \hat{T}_e + \hat{V}_{NN} + \hat{V}_{ee} + \hat{V}_{Ne}$$
  - after applying the (hartree) atomic units, simplified down to:
    - nuclear kinetic: $$\hat{T}_N = -\frac{1}{2} \Sigma_\alpha \frac{1}{M_\alpha} \nabla^2_\alpha$$
    - electronic kinetic:  $$\hat{T}_e = -\frac{1}{2} \Sigma_i \nabla^2_i$$
    - nuclear repulsion: $$\hat{V}_{NN} = \Sigma_{\alpha < \beta} \frac{Z_\alpha Z_\beta}{R_{\alpha\beta}}$$
    - electronic repulsion: $$\hat{V}_{ee} = \Sigma_{i < j} \frac{1}{r_{ij}}$$
    - electron-nuclear attraction: $$\hat{V}_{Ne} = \Sigma_{\alpha, i} \frac{-Z_\alpha}{r_{\alpha i}}$$
*** born-oopenheimer approximation
- the nucleus is much much more massive than the electron
- can separate motions of electrons and nucleus
  - electrons move with frozen geometry with nuclei fixed in space (what does it mean to move with fixed geometry)
    - when nuclei move, take calculations again
- total molecule: $$\hat{H}_{total} = \hat{T}_N + \hat{\textbf{T}}_e + \hat{V}_{NN} + \hat{\textbf{V}}_{ee} + \hat{\textbf{V}}_{Ne}$$
- we get the electronic hamiltonian with fixed nuclear parameters (framework): $$\hat{H}_e = \hat{T}_{e} + \hat{V}_{ee} + \hat{V}_{Ne}$$
  - $$\hat{H}_e \psi_k = E_k \psi_k$$, $$\psi_k(\{r_i\};\{R_\alpha \})$$
  - then we get $$\Psi_{total}$$ from expanding the basis set of electronic wavefunctions
    $$| \Psi_{total} (\{r_i\}, \{R_\alpha \}) \rangle = \Sigma_{k} \phi_{k} (\{R_\alpha \}) \dot | \psi_k(\{r_i\};\{R_\alpha \})$$
    - $$\phi$$ is nuclear, $$\Psi$$ is electronic
    $$(\hat{T}_N + \hat{V}_NN + \hat{H}_e) \Psi_{total} = E_{total} \Psi_{total} \rangle$$

*** adiabatic and BOA
- resulting BOA is still hard to solve: basis function (i think) $$(\hat{T}_N + E_l + \hat{V}_{NN})\phi_l + \Sigma_k \{ \phi_k \langle |\hat{T}_N |\rangle  + \Sigma_{\alpha = 1} \frac{\langle|\hat{P}_\alpha |\rangle \hat{P}_\alpha \phi_k}{M_\alpha}\} $$
- adiabatic: hopping between different electronic states is eliminated: only $$\phi_l$$ stays
  - to change quantum state, requires heat $$(\hat{T}_N + E_l + \hat{V}_{NN})_\phi_l + \phi_l \langle \psi_l | \hat{T}_N | \psi_l \rangle = E_{total} \phi_l$$
    - if nuclear framework doesn't move around, then second term is 0
- that is the BOA: nuclear framework does not move:
  $$(\hat{T}_N + E_l + \hat{V}_NN)\phi_l = E_{total} \phi_l$$
  - this is RHF energy: restricted hartree fock energy
  - electrons move and nucleus does not
- potential energy surface folows from BOA: $$\hat{T}_{NN} + V(\{R_\alpha \}) \phi(\{R_\alpha \}) = E_{total}  \phi(\{R_\alpha \})$$
  - there is no kinetic contributioN?
  - we need $$V(\{R_\alpha \}) = E_l + \hat{V}_NN$$ or the curve looks weird, there will be no minimum
    - contains all electgronic motions
    - nueclei move on PES, because we are shortening the distance between nuclei
      - PES gives net forces felt by nuclei due to complex motions/coulomb interactions of electrons
- electrons move so fast, not point to talk about electron motion
  - but shrodinger equation coupoles motion between electrons and nueclei
- BOA provides theoretical basis for existance of chemical structures
- BOA drawbacks:
  - independent of nuclear masses, PES for isotopes is the same
    - this implies electronic statse should be independent of particular isotopes of nuclei
      - but different isotopes change electronic structure as non-adibatic coupling terms depend on nuclear mass

*** lecture notes:
- polyatomic DOF: 3N
- the potential energy surface incorporates all types of energy (translational, rotational, vibrational)
- upper PES: repulsive, minimum is attractive representing a bond
  [[../../../../images/412/pes.png]]
- ZPE (zero point energy): for translational and rotational is 0 energy at 0K. But vibrational:
  - $$ZPE = \frac{1}{2} \hbar w$$
  - true ground state energy is $$D_0 = D - ZPE$$
    - why minus ZPE? and why is $D_0$ the true GSE?
*** potential energy surfaces (PES)
  - a molecule needs 3N coordinates to describe it
    - position (spatial): 3
    - rotations: 3 (2 for linear)
    - (internal degrees of freedom) vibrational: 3N - (3 + 2 or 3)
      - PES is described using these coordinates
- classifications
  - ab initio: from first principles
    - only need electronics $$\hat{H}_e$$: number of electrons and type of nuclei
  - empirical: functions constructed from values by fitting calculated properties to experimental data
    - Lennard-Jones PES: $$V_{LJ}(R) = V_0 [(\frac{R_0}{R})^12-2(\frac{R_0}{R})^6]$$
      - $$V_0$$ and $$R_0$$ are well depth and minimum of potential well respectively; determined from IR
        - functional form: chemical intuition
        - parameters: experimental
    - semi-empirical: mixture
- 412: concerned with ab initio
- larger molecules use empirical potentials
- anatomy of PES
  - attractive state: has a well representing a bond
  - repulsive state: no stable bond, not really a well, like a ball rolling down until reaching dissociation limit
  - $$R \rightarrow 0$$: PESs climb to higher energies because of electron cloud repulsion and then more steeply from nuclear repulsive term
- Gaussian finds $$R_0$$, at the minimum of PES
  - matches experimental structure at low vibrational states
- vibrational analysis
  - approximations based on harmonic oscillator
    - approximated in Taylor series, which we can simplify to parabola
      - matches behaviour at the well, but elsewhere does not
    - approximation has 5-10% difference from experimental values; even with exact PES using the harmonic approximation will lead to errors
- how is this done for a PES of $p$ dimensions:
  1. find stationary point where all first derivatives are 0 (makes taylor series expansion simpler?)
  2. expand PES in multidimensional Taylor series about stationary point keeping only quadratic term (linear terms 0 because of step 1.)
  3. form Hessian matrix, where diagonals are pure second derivative and everything else is mixed second derivative.
  4. diagonalize the Hessian to find new set of coordinates, which are normal modes, $$q_i$$.
     - $$q_i$$ is a linear combination of original $$\{R_i\}$$ coordinates.
5. in normal mode basis, only pure second derivatives remain. mixed second derivative terms are zero; no coupling between different normal modes. each normal mode is independent of others, so the pure second derivative can be used to define a harmonic oscillator
   - $$p$$ normal modes, $$p$$ harmonic oscillators
6. ZPE is sum of harmonic frequencies multiplied by $$\frac{\hbar}{2}$$

side notes:
- normal modes are uncoupled, unlike bond coordinates; exciting one normal mode doesn't affect other normal modes
- can use symmetry to simplify calculations regarding normal modes
- must use same method and same basis set to perform vibrational analysis as was used for geo opt; different methods approximate different stationary points
- normal modes used to characterize stationary points (?).

*** crossing and non-crossing PES
- NaCl: at limit of R goes to infinity; covalent bond does not have minimum, while ionic bond has minimum
  - these two graphs cross: PESs obtained with Born-Oppenheimer approximation
    - total wavefunction is product of nuclear and electron
  - in real system, there are interactions with the two PESs and there is no crossing: avoided crossing point: non-Born-Oppenheimer effect
    - total wavefunction is linear combination of $$\psi_{electron}^{ion}$$ and $$\psi_{electron}^{covalent}$$, with some expansion coefficients
*** reaction paths, transition states and intermediates
- 1D path, single normal mode
- PES for 2D case: TS is saddle point
- perpendicular modes: not along reaction path, bound vibrations
  - normal mode frequencies are positive numbers
- important to include ZPE into calculations of energy because of exponential dependence upon $$\Delta E^t$$
  - ZPE only uses positive normal mode frequencies
*** diabatic and adiabatic processes
- adiabatic theorem: QM system subject to gradually changing systems can adapt it's functional form
- diabatic: rapidly changing conditions prevent system from adapting its configuration, so probability density remains unchanged? no eigenstate of final Hamiltonian with same functional form; system ends in linear combination of stats that sum to reproduce initial probability density
- adiabatic: gradually changing allow system to adapt configuration, probability density is modified. starts in eigenstate of initial Hamiltonian and ends in eigenstate of final Hamiltonian.

*** basis sets
- spatial part of spin orbital expressed as linear combination of atomic orbitals
- natural expand MOs in terms of AOs
  - hydrogen-like atomic orbitals (time consuming)
  - ab initio MO theory: Slater-type orbitals (STOs) or Gaussian-type (GTOs) are used as basis sets

*** hydrogen-like atomic orbitals
- solution of following equation: $$(-\frac{1}{2}\nabla^2 - \frac{Z}{r}) \psi(r) = E \psi (r)$$
  - in spherical coordinates: $$\psi_{nlm}(r, \theta, \rho) = R_{nl}(r) Y_{lm}(\theta, \rho)$$
- slater-type orbitals: expressed in spherical coordinate system  - $$\chi^{STO}_{nlm} = NY_{lm}(\theta, \rho)r^{n-1}e^{-\zeta r}$$
  - exponential decay at long range, Kato's cusp condition at short range, no radial nodes
    - not convenient numerically: integral evaluation over STOs done numerically (why does this introduce error)
    - Kato's cusp condition: electron density has cusp at position of nuclei
- gaussian-type orbital (also in spherical coordinate system):
  - $$\chi^{STO}_{nlm} = NY_{lm}(\theta, \rho)r^{2n-2-l}e^{-\zeta r^2}$$
  - can be evaluated with analytical formulae (Gaussian Product Theorem): product of two GTOs centered on different atoms is finite sum of Gaussian functions centered on point along axis connecting them: saves time and elimiates error in determining matrix elements
    - incorrect physical behaviour of GTOs: decays much faster for large r.
    - do not satisfy Kato's kusp condition
  - instead use contracted sets (CGTOs) of primitive GTOs (PGTOs) normally used: $$\chi^{CGTO} = \sum^k_i a_i \chi^{PGTO}_i$$
    - for STO-3G: three PGTOs form each CGTO to mimic one STO

*** comments:
- core orbitals contribute most of overall energy but least to chemical bonding, valance orbitals most important chemically but contribute little to overall energy
  - basis functions constructed in a way to describe valence orbitals energies better than core orbitals
  - absolute energies quite off, but relative energies are accurate
    - need to use same method and basis set for all calculations
- basis set superposition error: accessible basis sets different in two calculations
  - when two calculations have different basis function space, the calculation with larger basis function space will
    - add ghost molecules to account for BSSE (CP method)
    - present in almost all calculations

** 11
- ZPE (zero point energy): for translational and rotational is 0 energy at 0K. But vibrational:
  - $$ZPE = \frac{1}{2} \hbar w$$
  - true ground state energy is $$D_0 = D - ZPE$$
    - why minus ZPE? and why is $D_0$ the true GSE?
      - ZPE is always bigger than 0
    - $D_0$ represents energy to break a bond, enthaply required to break a bond:
      - $$AB \rightarrow A + B$$
      - $$\Delta H = (H(A) + H(B) - H(A-B)) = (E_{diss} + E_{diss ZPE}) - (E_{bond} + E_{bond ZPE}) = - (E_{bond} - E_{bond ZPE})$$
- frequencies: positive represents stationary state (minimum), negative represent transition state (maximum)
  - for a true transition state, you can either go back or to the final product, so there will be only one negative (or imaginary) frequency
    - negative frequencies not included in ZPE
- Morse vs. Harmonic: at higher quantum states, the differences are too large, harmonic is less accurate
*** PES interactions
- BOA: predicts crossing (why?) because the equatio is single product?
  - single product may break down and not correctly describe total wavefunction
  - what does it mean to be fixed by ZPE?
  - contradicts the existance of sodium ions and elemental sodium
- non BOA: avoided crossing $$\Psi_{total} = c_ion \Psi^{ion}_{total} c_cov \Psi^{cov}_{total}$$
[[../../../../images/412/noncross.png]]
- from the hamiltonian matrix, if $$$H_{12} = 0$, then PES crossing happens with no problem
  - this happens when $$\Psi_1$$ and $$\Psi_2$$ are different spins or point groups
*** adiabatic and nondiabetic processes
[[../../../../images/412/dia.png]]
- fast: mixed states on upper and lower PESs
  - $$\Psi_d = c_+ \Psi_+ + c_- \Psi_-$$
  - $$E_d = |c_+|^2E_+ + |c_-|^2E_-$$
- slow: process ends up in pure state in lower PES
  - $$\Psi_a = \Psi_-$$
  - $$E_a = E_-$$
*** quiz questions
- breaking bonds fast or slow means changing the motion of the nuclei fast or slow
- fast bond breaking by shooting strong, intense laser
- vibrational frequencies: at TS only one vib freq is imaginary (or negative)
- PES crossing: depends on the interaction energy, represented by $$H_{12}$$
