- slater vs. gaussian
  [[../../../images/412/svg.png]]
  - gaussian decays too quickly and has longer tails
    - ill behaving because decays too fast
    - near nuclei (at origin), is flat, differential is 0
  - slater is proper function to use
    - not differentiable because of cusp (at origin)
  - predict different behaviour at nuclei (experimentally by EPR)
    - should anticipate some mistakes
- review 6 ways non-differentiability
