# What to expect: 

# Overall thoughts: 
I took the second iteration of this course, and I could tell the instructors worked hard to create a well-rounded syllabus. We used R in this course to do a lot of data analysis. The instructors also created their textbooks and interactive labs. There is also a final project associated with this course in which you choose a piece of data to analyze. The exams were all online and tested concepts and coding in R.

I highly recommend this course if you are someone from a non-coding background interested in data science, but those who can already code should also take this course if you are interested in data science.
