# What to expect:
I took this introductory biology course in the summer of COVID-19, so it was all online. Having not taken Biology 30 (grade 12), I found this course pretty manageable. If you remember your grade 12 biology you will be set. This covers cell biology, and not much (just a bit) about genetics. 

I don't remember how the exams were unfortunately.

# Overall thoughts
I mean, you need this course for higher year biology courses so for biology majors there's no evading this course. I don't really think this course stands out too much so I wouldn't take it if you didn't need to (unless you wanted a good basic understanding of cell biology). Some courses I did want to take actually required BIOL 121 and not BIOL 112 to make sure to double check if BIOL 112 is a prereq for higher year courses you are interested in.
