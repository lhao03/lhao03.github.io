type: "notes"

** Explain the role of the partition coefficient in separation and extraction techniques and describe the physical and chemical principles underlying separations.
- partition coefficient: $$K = \frac{[A]_1}{[A]_2}$$
  - how the analyte distributes between two phases based on equilibrium constant
- chromatography: carry out many seperatation steps for mixtures
  - a column filled with SP
  - sample added in solvent (MP), poured into column
  - analyte moves between the phases based on partition coefficient ($$K = \frac{[A]_{mob}}{[A]_{stat}}$$), eventually moving out of the column
    - spending more time in SP means spending more time in the column
** Describe and compare the different types and modes of chromatography with reference to the stationary and mobile phases and elution methods:
*** Adsorption vs. partition
- adsorption (on): only bind to surface of SP
  - silica, alumina (SP)
  - TLC: solvent (MP)
  - column chromatography:
    - column packed with silica/alumina
    - elute with organic solvent as MP
- partition (in): solute dissolved in liquid phase
  - HPLC
*** Reverse vs. normal phase
- reverse phase: MP is polar, SP is non polar (phenyl, C)
  - analytes that are polar will elute faster (spend less time in SP)
- normal phase: MP is non polar (hexane, diethyl ether, ethyl acetate), SP is polar (silica, amino)
  - analytes that are less polar will elute faster (spend less time in SP)
*** LC vs. GC
- LC:
  - more applicable to any soluble compounds
  - more versatile MP,SP
  - compounds collected after
  - less sample prep
  - UV/Vis
- GC:
  - require volatile/thermally stable compounds
  - faster
  - more sensitive, better resolution => more plates
  - more universal detectors
  - equipment less expensive
*** Isocratic/isothermal vs. gradient/temperature programming
**** LC
- general elution problem:
  - more polar MP: poor late resolution
  - more nonpolar MP: poor early resolution
  - reverse phase: polar to nonpolar
  - normal?
- gradient (programming) elution:
  - isocratic: same elution throughout
**** GC
$$ u = \sqrt{\frac{B}{C}}$$
- temperature programming
*** Analytical vs. preparatory
- analytical: actual column that does separation
- preparatory: guard, shorter, same MP?
** Predict the order of elution of compounds with either normal or reversed phase chromatography.
- reverse phase: MP is polar, SP is non polar (phenyl, C)
  - analytes that are polar will elute faster (spend less time in SP)
- normal phase: MP is non polar (hexane, diethyl ether, ethyl acetate), SP is polar (silica, amino)
  - analytes that are polar will elute faster (spend less time in SP)
** Interpret a simple chromatogram to identify the dead time, retention time, and calculate the partition coefficient, retention factor, and/or resolution.
- dead time: migration time, time for MP to travel the column
- retention time, adjusted retention time: time for analyte to elute from column
- retention factor: $$\frac{t_R - t_M}{t_M}$$
- resolution: occurs when more than 1.5
  - $$\frac{2 (t_{RB} - t_{RA})}{(\Delta t)_B + (\Delta t)_A}$$, where $$(\Delta t)_B$$ is the width of the peak with tangents drawn (the bottom)
  - $$\frac{1.178 (t_{RB} - t_{RA})}{(FWHM)_B + (FWHM)_A}$$, where $$(FWHM)_B$$ is the width at half height of the peak
** Describe the relationship between retention time, peak area, resolution and analytical figures of merit in quantitative and qualitative analysis using chromatography.
- plate height: the more plates, the narrower the peak obtained
  - $$N = \frac{16 t^2_R}{w^2}$$. where $w$ is width, the longer time spent in column, the more plates, the wider the peak, the less plates
- resolution:
 - $$\frac{\sqrt{N}}{4} \frac{\alpha - 1}{\alpha} \frac{k_B}{1 + k_B} = \sqrt{N}}{4} (1 - \frac{t_{RA}}{t_{RB}})$$, where $$\alpha = \frac{k_B}{k_A}$$ and B is retained longer
** Describe Van Deemter Equation and its applications in improving LC and GC separation performance
- sources of band broadening:
  - (A) eddy diffusion (multiple paths):
    - solute take different paths through column packing
    - smaller particle size => paths before more uniform, minimizing A
      - diffusion length (distance needed to travel to SP) decreases, reducing C
    - porous particles: better with larger overall particle sizes/lower pressures, lower C
  - (B/v) longitudinal diffusion (based on concentration of analytes): diffusion from high concentrations to low concentrations
  - (Cv) mass transfer effect: partitioning kinetics slow relative to MP flow rate (v), then peak is broadened
    - if analyte moves in MP, the SP "catches up", but the new eq has a broader width
      - want: fast mass transfer relative to mobile phase velocity
      - peak broadened: analyte diffusion is slow, or MP velocity is fast: can't get close to eq
** Draw and label a block diagram of LC and GC systems and explain the role of each component, the characteristics of columns, and the operation and capabilities of detectors.
**** LC
- components of HPLC:
  1. HPLC pump for liquid mobile phase
     - (before) solvent reservoir
  2. injector for sample
  3. HPLC column
     - (before) guard column
     - (before) precolumn filter
  4. detector, where waste leaves after
     - (after) back pressure regulator: prevents bubbles from forming in detector
  5. electronics, computer
     - UV/Vis detector: Z-shape to offer longer path length that gives better sensitivity
       - diode array: full spectra => speed
- HPLC/UPLC
  - HPLC* => HPLC => UPLC
  - irregular => spherical =>
  - decreasing size, increasing pressure
- HPLC column:
  - bonded stationary phases: functional groups bonded to silica particles
**** GC
- temperature makes analytes go into gas phase
  - analytes can be in vapour phase, condense in SP, dissolve in SP
- components of GC:
  1. mobile phase (gas cylinder): gas dry and free of impurities
  2. flow regulator
  3. injection system (temperature controlled)
     - split: not all sample goes in
     - splitless: all sample goes in
  4. column with oven (temperature controlled)
  5. detector
     - flame ionization:
       - signal proportionate to mass
       - hydrocarbons burnt, no response to fully oxidized carbons
       - universal, cheap, fast, dynamic range $10^7$, detection low as: $10^-{12}$ g C/s
- capillary columns:
  - little SP compared to LC
  - need less analyte
  - open tubular design: minimize multiple paths, A => 0, H minimized
**** capillary electrophoresis
- separation of analytes based on making them move in electric field
- quantitative
- flow analytes through narrow capillary, past detector
- electrostatic driving force
- drag: friction
- as ion gets faster, drag force increases
  - acceleration goes to zero as these forces balance
- eletrophoretic mobility: $$\mu_{ep} = \frac{q}{f}E = \mu_{ep}E$$
  - bigger molecules, smaller mobility, because harder to push past solvent molecules
  - higher charge: larger mobility, larger driving force
- solvent moves too
  - $$\mu_{app} = \mu_{ep} + \mu_{eo}$$, ion movement and solvent movement
- better resolution becase, A goes to zero (open tube), C goes to 0 since no SP, H is much smaller

*** textbook reading
**** 12B
- characterize chromatographic peak: retention time, baseline width
- nonretained solutes: move through column at same rate as mobile phase => gives us void time (time to elute the nonretained solutes)
- resolution: measure of their separation: $$R_{AB} = \frac{t_{r, B} - t_{r, A}}{0.5 (w_B + w_A)} = 2 \frac{\Delta t_t}{w_B + w_A}$$, where B takes longer to elute
  - improve by either increasing $\Delta t_t$ or decreasing $w_B + w_A$
    - both solutes spend less time in mobile phase => retention factor
    - increase selectivity => only one solute experience significant change in retention time
    - baseline width: solutes movement within and between mobile phase/stationary phase => column efficiency
***** solute retention factor
- the larger the retention factor, the more the distribution favors solute in stationary phase, and longer retention time
$$k = \frac{t_t - t_m}{t_m}$$
***** selectivity
- relative measure of retention of two solutes, $\alpha = \frac{k_B}{k_A}$, where A has smaller retention time
***** column efficiency
- quantitative measure of extent of band broadening: number of theoretical plates $N = \frac{L}{H}$, where L is column length and H is height of theoretical plate => more theoretical plates => chromatographic peaks become narrower
- theoretical model of chromatography => theoretical plates
  - within each theoretical plate: eq between solute present in stationary phase and solute present in mobile phase
- given a Gaussian profile: $$H = \frac{\sigma^2}{L}$$
- width is 4 times the standard deviation
- gives us $$H = \frac{Lw^2}{16 t^2_r}$$
***** peak capacity
- estimate of number of solutes we can seperate
**** 12C: optimizing chromatographic separations
- $$$R_{AB} = \frac{t_{t, B} - t_{t, A}}{0.5 (w_B + w_A)}$ or approximately equal $$\frac{t_{t, B} - t_{t, A}}{0.5 (2 w_B)} = \frac{t_{t, B} - t_{t, A}}{w_B}$$, where B is the later eluting of two solutes
  - which we get $$$R_{AB} = \frac{\sqrt{N_B}}{4} \times \frac{t_{t, B} - t_{t, A}}{t_{t, B}} = \frac{\sqrt{N_B}}{4} \times \frac{\alpha - 1}{\alpha} \times \frac{k_B - k_A}{1 + k_B}$
***** using retention factor
- adjust B's retention factor, $k_B$, increasing will improve resolution, best if $k_B$ starts out being less than 10 => cost of longer analysis time
- to increase $k_B$ without changing $\alpha$ => nonselective increase to both retention factors
  - GC: temperature (decrease)
  - LC: weaker mobile phase solvent
- adjusting retention factors => too long of a retention time => general elution problem
  - make adjustments to retention factor throughout separation
***** using selectivity
- if alpha is 1, not possible to improve resolution by adjusting solute retention factor or column efficiency
  - to change, selectivity adjust solute retention factors
***** using column efficiency
- increase number of theoretical plates, N
  - double N by doubling L, or cut the height
- contributions to band broadening:
  - variations in path length (multiple paths)
    - contribution to height of theoretical plate: $H_p = 2 \lambda d_p$
      - for column without packing material, $H_p$ is zero and no contribution to band broadening from multiple paths
        - more uniform packing material reduces this problem
  - longitudinal diffusion in mobile phase
    - solute diffuses from high solute concentration to low solute concentration
  - mass transfer in SP and MP
    - movement between phases (mobile and stationary phase)
    - band broadening occurs if solute's movement within MP or SP is not fast enough to maintain an eq in its concentration between the two phases
      - solute in MP moves down column before it passes into SP
      - solute in SP moves takes longer than expected to move back into MP
      - smaller velocity => more time for mass transfer
***** putting it all together
height of theoretical plate: $$H = H_p + H_d + H_s + H_m$$, where the contributions are path length, longitudinal diffusion, mass transfer in SP, mass transfer in MP
- another form is van deemter equation: $$H = A + B/u + Cu$$, where $A$ is multiple paths, $B/u$ accounts for longitudinal diffusion, $Cu$ accounts for mass transfer
- to increase number of theoretical plates
  - adjust velocity of mobile phase
    - smaller mobile phase velocity: column efficiency limited by longitudinal diffusion
    - higher mobile phase: two mass transfer terms
  - column itself
    - decrease particle size
    - open-tubular or capillary columns
      - small diameter
      - no packing material
      - interior is coated with SP
    - $H_p$ disappears, $H_m$ decreases => $H$ decreases
    - takes less pressure to move down column => length increases
    - difficult to inject reproducible
- use thin films of SP
  - decrease $H_s$
- decreasing particle size (in SP):
  - various number of paths become more uniform
  - distance to get back into SP becomes smaller, so mass transfer decreases
  - backpressure increases
- superficially porous particles => shorter diffusion length, minimize mass transfer, less pressure
- monolithic column: pack with one material, network of pores, less pressure
  - lower pressure, higher flow rate, or make column longer
**** 12D gas chromatography
gas MP
- carry solute through packed/capillary column, that separates sample components based on ability to partition between MP and SP
- components: compressed gas for MP, heated injector (volatilizes components in liquid sample), a column (in oven), detector
- packed column: larger sample
  - filled with packing material
  - glass rinsed to prevent adsorption of solute
- capillary column:
  - better theoretical plate, longer
  - smaller diameter, require smaller sample
gas SP
  - elution order: boiling points of solutes/interaction between solutes and SP
    - nonpolar solutes => more easy to seperate with nonpolar SP
    - polar solutes => more easy to seperate with polar SP
  - liquid SP: bleed, or tendency to elute when column is heated
sample introduction
- volatile
- appropriate concentration
- don't degrade the separation (accidently injecting liquid sample or directly into moving stream of gas MP)
  - packed: sample injected directly into column (mixes sample with least amount of carrier gas), heated above BP of least volatile solute
  - capillary: need to use split/splitless
    - split injection: injected into glass liner to mix with carrier gas
      - only some gets injected, rest leaves
    - splitless: allow all sample to enter column => significant precolumn band broadening is problem
      - cool the column => solvent condences, traps solutes, then raise temperature back up
temperature control
- isothermal => set slightly below lowest boiling point solute
  - causes high boiling point solute to have very long retention time => temperature programming
- detectors:
  - thermal conductivity detector: measure thermal conductivity as MP exits column (universal detector)
    - poor detection limit for most analytes
  - flame ionization detector: combustion of organic compound in hydrogen gas flame => electrons and organic cations => suuply potential creates current => when amplified => signal
    - many organic cations generate signal
    - inorganic compounds not detected
    - better detection limit
  - electron capture detector
    - highly selective towards solute electronegative functional groups
    - insensitive to amines, alcohol, hydrocarbons
    - excellent detection limit, but linear range only extend over two orders of magnitude
  - mass spectrometer
    - GCMS
    - mass to charge ratio
**** 12E high performance liquid chromatography
- liquid MP
- components: reservoir for MP, pump for pushing MP through system, injector for introducing sample, column for separating the sample into component parts, detector for monitoring the eluent

HPLC columns
- analytical column: responsible for separation
  - packed with silica
  - capillary column use less solvent, can also be packed => back pressure that develops when pumping liquid
  - monolithic column: solid support is single, porous rod
- guard column: placed beore sepration to protect from contamination
  - solute that bind to SP (and wont come off)
  - particulate material that clog
  - same packing material and SP and shorter
- SP
  - covalently bond to silica particles
  - bonded stationary phases: reacting silica particles with organochlorosilane with R group (determines property of SP)
    - normal phase: polar SP, nonpolar MP
    - reverse phase: nonpolar SP, mobile MP
- MP
  - elution order governed by polarity
    - normal phase: less polar solutes elutes first
    - reverse phase: more polar solute elutes first
  - isocratic and gradient elutions
  - move MP => dissolve gases, remove particulate matter => inject sample => loop injector
  - detector: spectroscopic
    - diode array
    - UV/Vis detector
  - detector: electrochemical
  - refractive index, mass spec
- comparison:
  - loop injector: makes LC have better precision
  - volume: LC has more
  - LC not limited to volatile, can analyze broader range, applicable to any soluble compound, more versatile, can collect compounds after, less sample prep
  - GC: more plates, can seperate more complex mixtures (higher resolution because more plates), faster, more universal detectors and less expensive
    - no prep-scale GC because so narrow, but diameter so small so less mass transfer

**** 12 F other forms
***** liquid-solid adsorption
- column packing is also SP
- SP is polar, MP is nonpolar
***** ion-exchange
- SP is cross-linked polymer resin with covalently attached ionic functional groups
***** size-exclusion
- ability of solute to enter pores of SP

*** key words
- adjusted retention time:  $t^, = t_t - t_m$, where t_m is the time column's void time, and $t_t$ is time between injection time and solute peak
- adsorption chromatography: flow solute over some surface, desired solute attaches onto the medium, not in the medium
- band broadening: when sample is injected => narrow band, and as sample passes through column, band broadens => band broadening
  - column efficiency = extend of band broadening
- baseline width: extending tangent lines from inflection points on either side of peak through the baseline

[[../../../../../../images/211/chromatogram.png]]

- bleed: problem with liquid stationary phases, as temperature increases, is likely or possible to elute
- bonded stationary phase: type of SP in capillary column, superior stability
  - is attached chemically attached to the capillary's silica surface
