**  Explain how different wavelengths of light interact with matter, including the concept of resonance, different types of transitions, chromophores/auxochromes, and selection rules.
- Definition of chromophore and auxochrome
  - chromophore: light absorbing groups (part of molecule)
    - 200 - 800 nm: pi-electron and hetero atoms with non-bonding valence shell electron pairs
    - non bonding electrons in water, alcohols, either don't absorb above 160nm, they are suitable solvents for spectroscopy
      - increasing/extending conjugation of unsaturated bonds decreases transition energies -> energy gap between HOMO and LUMO decreases
    - auxochrome: chemical group attached to chromophore that modifies its light absorption (alter energy of MOs)
      - acid-base indicators: isobestic point -> total absorbance stays the same (?)

| Nature of Shift    | Term         | How                                          |
|--------------------+--------------+----------------------------------------------|
| longer wavelength  | red shift    | adding double bonds                          |
| shorter wavelength | blue shift   |                                              |
| greater absorption | hyperchromic | doubles with each new conjugated double bond |
| lower absorption   | hypochromic  |                                              |

**  Draw and label a Jablonski energy level diagram and relate its features to absorption spectra.
- Bandwidths also depend on local environment (including effect of vib. & rotational levels)
  - we get absorption bands from electronic transitions, vibrational levels, rotational levels, other collections/interaction

**  Describe the processes that occur when UV-visible light is absorbed by a molecule, including excited states and relaxation processes.
- Relaxation pathways: fluorescence, internal conversion, intersystem crossing, phosphorescence
    - vibrational relaxation: energy lost to heat, electron stays in same electronic state
    - internal conversion: energy lost to heat, electron moves to lower electronic state, requires overlap between vibration levels and lower electronic state (horizontal energy transfer)
    - fluorescence: only occurs in singlet to singlet state
    - intersystem crossing: excited singlet move to excited triplet (or other way)
    - phosphorescence: only occurs in triplet to singlet state
    - light emitted from fluorescence or phosphorescence is always same or less than excitation wavelength
    - relative time frame:
      - absorption < vibration relaxation and internal conversion < fluorescence < phosphorescence (slow)

** Explain the differences between atomic and molecular absorption spectra.
*** UV/Vis spectra for molecules/ions
- difference in energy between HOMO and LUMO -> UV/Vis, absorption of photon is possible
- types of transitions, n is non bonding:
  - $$\sigma \rightarrow \sigma^*$$, 200 nm
  - $$n \rightarrow \sigma^*$$, 160-260 nm
  - $$\pi \rightarrow \pi^*$$, 200-500 nm
  - $$n \rightarrow \pi^*$$, 250-600 nm
- charge transfer: inorganic metal-ligand complexes, electron from metal transferred to ligand -> produce very large absorbance
- UV/Vis more broad than IR
  - UV/Vis absorption results in change to electronic energy levels and maybe vibrational -> number of closely spaced absorption bands that merge together to form single broad absorption band
 - IR absorption only results in change to vibrational energy levels
*** UV/Vis spectra for atoms
- enough energy to cause change in atom's valence electrons
- only allowed between $l +-1$$
- excited state lifetime is short
- narrow width in absorption lines, due to fixed difference in energy and lack of rotational/vibrational energy levels (width is $$10^{-5} - 10^{-3}$$ nm)

**  Explain the significance of the terms in the Beer-Lambert Law, and how they relate to molecular features and experimental design.
**  Explain the limitations of Beer’s Law.
**  Utilize Beer’s Law for determining the concentration of one or more analyte species from one or more absorbance measurements.
**  Relate the choice and arrangement of components in a spectrophotomer to its capabilities, performance, advantages and disadvantages.
**  Draw and label a detailed block diagram of a spectrophotometer, including the light path and components, and describe the function of each of those components.
**  Describe the operation of key components for measuring absorbance:
*** Light sources (tungsten, deuterium)
***  Monochromators (gratings and slits)
- filters have a fixed wavelength
- if we want to make measurements at different wavelengths -> need more than one filter
- monochromator: select narrow band of radiation, allow for continuous adjustment of band's nominal wavelength
  - nominal wavelength: the wavelength you want?
    - want high throughput of radiation and narrow effective bandwidth
[[../../../../../../images/211/nominal.jpg]]
[[../../../../../../images/211/monochomator.png]]
- collimating mirror: collects radiation
  - reflects parallel beam of radiation to diffraction grating
- differaction grating: optically reflecting surface with large number of parallel grooves
  - disperses radiation -> focused onto planar surface that contains exit slit
  - or prism
- converts polychromatic source of radiation to monochromatic source of finite bandwidth
- exit slit:
  - narrow: smaller effective bandwidth and better resolution, but smaller throughput of radiation
- can be fixed-wavelength or scanning
  - fixed: manually select wavelength by rotating grating

***  Sample cells (design and materials)
***  Photodetectors (PMT, photodiode, photodiode arrays)

*** misc notes
textbook notes:
- if energy ($$\hbar v$$) of photon is more than excited state - ground state, excitation occurs
- atom/molecule in excited state can emit photon of energy $$\hbar v$$
- you don't see the colors a substance absorbs
*** spectroscopy based on absorption
- absorbed wavelength intensities are attenuated
- for an analyte to absorb EMR:
  - there must be mechanism which EMR interacts with analyte -> UV/Vis changes energy of electrons, IR -> bond vibrational energy
  - photon energy must equal different in energy between two allowed energy states
**** IR spectra for molecules for polyatomic molecules:
- energy for allowed vibration mode: $$E_v = v + \frac{1}{2} h v_o$$
  - fundamental: +/- 1
  - overtone: +/- 2,3
******* transmittance and absorbance
- transmittance: $$$T = \frac{P_T}{P_0}$
[[../../../../../../images/211/p.png]]
- redefine $P_0$ from blank so we don't need to care about loss of light from the source
- absorbance is linear function of analyte concentration: $$A = -log T = - log \frac{P_T}{P_0}$$
  - require line source instead of continuum source because effective bandwidth is too large
