** 1.1: global perspectives
- QC and QI: study of information processing tasks accomplished using QM systems

*** 1.1.1: 
- classical physics were predicting absurdities -> UV catastrophe or electrons spiraling into the nucleus -> creation of QM 
- QM: set of rules for construction of physical theories
  - possible to use quantum effects to signal faster than light -> whether it is possible to clone an unknown quantum state (construct copy of QS) -> not possible in general with QM -> no-cloning theorem
- controlling single quantum systems -> trap single atom in atom trap, isolating from world allowing us to probe it -> explore untouched regimes in Nature
- computer science -> Church-Turing Theorem -> UTM complexly captures what it means to perform a task by algorithmic means
- quantum effects beginning to interfere in functioning of electronic devices as they are getting smaller and smaller
- failure of Moore's Law -> move to different computing paradigm
  - ordinary computer can simulate QC but not efficiently (polynomial time)
- strengthened version of Church-Turing thesis:Any algorithmic process can be simulated efficiently using a Turing machine -> for purposes of analyzing whether a given computational task can be accomplished efficiently, restrict ourselves to analysis of Turing machine model
- analog computation: analog computers can solve efficiently when Turing machines can't -> violation? but when assumption about presence of noise in analog computers is made, their power disappears?? 
  - unlike analog computation, QM can tolerate finite amount of noise and retain computational advantages
- first challenge: number is prime or composite using randomized algorithm -> could only determine if probably prime/composite -> perform the algorithm a few times
- ad hoc modification -> Any algorithmic process can be simulated efficiently using a probabilistic Turing machine
- Deutsch: can laws of physics be used to derive stronger version of Church-Turing thesis -> computational device capable of efficiently simulating an arbitrary physical system -> because laws of physics were QM -> quantum analogs of machines defined by Turing
- Universal Quantum Computer ?
- quantum computers may be able to efficiently solve problems that have no efficient solution on a probabilistic Turing machine
    - Shor and Grover algorithms
- Feynman: essential difficulties in simulating quantum mechanics with classical computers -> build computers based on principles of quantum mechanics to avoid difficulties
- algorithm design for quantum computers is hard because
    . human intuition is rooted in classical world
    . must design an algorithm that is better than existing classical algorithm, not just QM!
- while computer science was exploding, information theory was too
- Shannon: mathematically define concept of information
    - two key questions about communication of information: 
        - what resources are required to send information over communications channel?
        - can information be transmitted in a way that is protected against noise in communications channel
    - two fundamental theories: 
        - noiseless channel coding theorem: quantifies physical resources required to store the output from information source
        - noisy channel coding theorem: quantifies how much information it is possible to reliably transmit through noisy communications channel -> upper limit on protection afforded by error-correcting codes
- to achieve reliable transmission in presence of noise: error-correcting codes
- quantum information theory: 
    - Schumacher: quantum bit/qubit has tangible physical resource (analogue to noiseless coding theorem)
    - but no analogue to noisy channel coding theorem
- theory of quantum error-correction has been developed: allows QC to compute efficiently in presence of noise and allow communication over noisy quantum channels
- CSS (Calderbank, Shor, Steane) codes and stabilizer codes (Calderbank, Rains, Shor, Sloane)
    - quantum error-correcting codes: protect quantum states against noise  - transmitting ordinary classical information using quantum channel? 
    - Bennett/Wiesner: transmit two classical bits of information while only transmitting one quantum bit -> superdense coding
- distributed QC: QC require exponentially less communication to solve certain problems
- study of information theory: properties of single communications channel 
  - in applications: networks of many channels -> networked information theory: information carrying properties of networks of communication channels -> very developed
  - networked quantum information theory, still in infancy, no unifying theory of networked information theory exists for quantum channels
- cryptography: communication and computation between two paries who may not trust each other
  - private key cryptosystems: A and B communicate by sharing a private key (only they know)
    - problems: how to distribute the keys? 
    - QM can be used to distrbute keys such that A and B's security is not compromised -> quantum cryptography -> observation disturbs the system being observed -> an observer would be visible as disturbance of communications channel
  - public key cryptosystems: B publishes a key available to the general public, A can use this key to encrypt a message but a third party cannot use the public key to decrypt the message. B has secret key matched to the public key.
    - solve problem of key distribution
    - RSA cryptosystem -> most widely deployed key cryptosystem
    - difficult to invert encryption stage if only public key available -> belief that this cannot be solved on classical computer (factoring), but it can be solved on QC!
- quantum entanglement: uniquely QM resource

*** 1.1.2: future
- think physically about computation
- any physical theory -> basis for theory of information processing and communication
- think computationally about physics -> physics about understanding elementary objects/simple systems, interesting things happen when things are larger and more complicated (chemistry and engineering, ad hoc fashion)
- computation and algorithms as systematic means of constructing and understanding (small and relatively complex) systems

** 1.2: quantum bits
- mathematical objects with certain specific properties 
- abstract entity: construct a general theory of QC/QI that doesn't depend on specific system
- qubit can be $| 0 \rangle$, $| 1 \rangle$ or a linear combination of states $|\psi \rangle = \alpha | 0 \rangle + \beta | 1 \rangle$ (superposition)
  - vector in 2D space
  - computational basis states: $| 0 \rangle$, $| 1 \rangle$ -> form orthoormal basis for this vector space
  - we cannot examine a qubit to determine it's quantum state
  - qubit's state is unit vector in 2D complex vector space
  - lack of direct correspondence between elements of abstraction and real world with qubits -> there is indirect correspondence for qubit states to be manipulated and transformed to lead to measurement outcomes -> these quantum states have real, experimentally verifiable consequences.
- exist in continuum of states until it is observed
- because $|\alpha|^2 + |\beta|^2 = 1$ we can say: $|\psi \rangle = e^{i \gamma} (cos (\theta/2) + e^{i \phi} sin (\theta / 2))$
    - $\theta$ and $\phi$ define a point on unit three-dimensional sphere (Bloch sphere)
    - Bloch sphere can be used to describe single qubits

[[../../../images/qc/bloch.png]]

- how much information represented by a qubit -> infinite number of points on unit sphere so infinite binary expansion of $\theta$
  - not true: measurement changes the state of qubit, collasping the superposition
    - only 0 or 1, so measurement only returns one state
- would need to measure infinite number of qubits to determine $\alpha$ and $\beta$
  - how much information is represented by a qubit if we do not measure it? -> potential amount of "hidden information" grows exponentially with more qubits

*** 1.2.1: multiple qubits
- two qubits have four computational basis states:
  $$|\psi \rangle = \alpha_{00} | 00 \rangle + \alpha_{01} | 01 \rangle + \alpha_{10} | 10 \rangle + \alpha_{11} | 11 \rangle$$
- $\{0,1\}^2$: set of strings of length 2 with each letter either one or zero
- measuring the first qubit as 0 gives probability $|\alpha_{00}|^2 + |\alpha_{01}|^2$ and post-measurement state: $$|\psi ' \rangle = \frac{(\alpha_{00} | 00 \rangle + \alpha_{01} | 01 \rangle)} {\sqrt{|\alpha_{00}|^2 + |\alpha_{01}|^2)}}$$
- important two qubit state, Bell state or EPR pair: $$\frac{|00\rangle + |11 \rangle}{\sqrt{2}}$$
  - key ingredient in quantum teleportation and superdense coding
