** 1.1: global perspectives
- QC and QI: study of information processing tasks accomplished using QM systems

*** 1.1.1: 
- classical physics were predicting absurdities -> UV catastrophe or electrons spiraling into the nucleus -> creation of QM 
- QM: set of rules for construction of physical theories
  - possible to use quantum effects to signal faster than light -> whether it is possible to clone an unknown quantum state (construct copy of QS) -> not possible in general with QM -> no-cloning theorem
- controlling single quantum systems -> trap single atom in atom trap, isolating from world allowing us to probe it -> explore untouched regimes in Nature
- computer science -> Church-Turing Theorem -> UTM complexly captures what it means to perform a task by algorithmic means
- quantum effects beginning to interfere in functioning of electronic devices as they are getting smaller and smaller
- failure of Moore's Law -> move to different computing paradigm
  - ordinary computer can simulate QC but not efficiently (polynomial time)
- strengthened version of Church-Turing thesis:Any algorithmic process can be simulated efficiently using a Turing machine -> for purposes of analyzing whether a given computational task can be accomplished efficiently, restrict ourselves to analysis of Turing machine model
- analog computation: analog computers can solve efficiently when Turing machines can't -> violation? but when assumption about presence of noise in analog computers is made, their power disappears?? 
  - unlike analog computation, QM can tolerate finite amount of noise and retain computational advantages
- first challenge: number is prime or composite using randomized algorithm -> could only determine if probably prime/composite -> perform the algorithm a few times
- ad hoc modification -> Any algorithmic process can be simulated efficiently using a probabilistic Turing machine
- Deutsch: can laws of physics be used to derive stronger version of Church-Turing thesis -> computational device capable of efficiently simulating an arbitrary physical system -> because laws of physics were QM -> quantum analogs of machines defined by Turing
- Universal Quantum Computer ?
- quantum computers may be able to efficiently solve problems that have no efficient solution on a probabilistic Turing machine
    - Shor and Grover algorithms
- Feynman: essential difficulties in simulating quantum mechanics with classical computers -> build computers based on principles of quantum mechanics to avoid difficulties
- algorithm design for quantum computers is hard because
    . human intuition is rooted in classical world
    . must design an algorithm that is better than existing classical algorithm, not just QM!
- while computer science was exploding, information theory was too
- Shannon: mathematically define concept of information
    - two key questions about communication of information: 
        - what resources are required to send information over communications channel?
        - can information be transmitted in a way that is protected against noise in communications channel
    - two fundamental theories: 
        - noiseless channel coding theorem: quantifies physical resources required to store the output from information source
        - noisy channel coding theorem: quantifies how much information it is possible to reliably transmit through noisy communications channel -> upper limit on protection afforded by error-correcting codes
- to achieve reliable transmission in presence of noise: error-correcting codes
- quantum information theory: 
    - Schumacher: quantum bit/qubit has tangible physical resource (analogue to noiseless coding theorem)
    - but no analogue to noisy channel coding theorem
- theory of quantum error-correction has been developed: allows QC to compute efficiently in presence of noise and allow communication over noisy quantum channels
- CSS (Calderbank, Shor, Steane) codes and stabilizer codes (Calderbank, Rains, Shor, Sloane)
    - quantum error-correcting codes: protect quantum states against noise  - transmitting ordinary classical information using quantum channel? 
    - Bennett/Wiesner: transmit two classical bits of information while only transmitting one quantum bit -> superdense coding
- distributed QC: QC require exponentially less communication to solve certain problems
- study of information theory: properties of single communications channel 
  - in applications: networks of many channels -> networked information theory: information carrying properties of networks of communication channels -> very developed
  - networked quantum information theory, still in infancy, no unifying theory of networked information theory exists for quantum channels
- cryptography: communication and computation between two paries who may not trust each other
  - private key cryptosystems: A and B communicate by sharing a private key (only they know)
    - problems: how to distribute the keys? 
    - QM can be used to distrbute keys such that A and B's security is not compromised -> quantum cryptography -> observation disturbs the system being observed -> an observer would be visible as disturbance of communications channel
  - public key cryptosystems: B publishes a key available to the general public, A can use this key to encrypt a message but a third party cannot use the public key to decrypt the message. B has secret key matched to the public key.
    - solve problem of key distribution
    - RSA cryptosystem -> most widely deployed key cryptosystem
    - difficult to invert encryption stage if only public key available -> belief that this cannot be solved on classical computer (factoring), but it can be solved on QC!
- quantum entanglement: uniquely QM resource

*** 1.1.2: future
- think physically about computation
- any physical theory -> basis for theory of information processing and communication
- think computationally about physics -> physics about understanding elementary objects/simple systems, interesting things happen when things are larger and more complicated (chemistry and engineering, ad hoc fashion)
- computation and algorithms as systematic means of constructing and understanding (small and relatively complex) systems

** 1.2: quantum bits
- mathematical objects with certain specific properties 
- abstract entity: construct a general theory of QC/QI that doesn't depend on specific system
- qubit can be $| 0 \rangle$, $| 1 \rangle$ or a linear combination of states $|\psi \rangle = \alpha | 0 \rangle + \beta | 1 \rangle$ (superposition)
  - vector in 2D space
  - computational basis states: $| 0 \rangle$, $| 1 \rangle$ -> form orthoormal basis for this vector space
  - we cannot examine a qubit to determine it's quantum state
  - qubit's state is unit vector in 2D complex vector space
  - lack of direct correspondence between elements of abstraction and real world with qubits -> there is indirect correspondence for qubit states to be manipulated and transformed to lead to measurement outcomes -> these quantum states have real, experimentally verifiable consequences.
- exist in continuum of states until it is observed
- because $|\alpha|^2 + |\beta|^2 = 1$ we can say: $|\psi \rangle = e^{i \gamma} (cos (\theta/2) + e^{i \phi} sin (\theta / 2))$
    - $\theta$ and $\phi$ define a point on unit three-dimensional sphere (Bloch sphere)
    - Bloch sphere can be used to describe single qubits

[[../../../images/qc/bloch.png]]

- how much information represented by a qubit -> infinite number of points on unit sphere so infinite binary expansion of $\theta$
  - not true: measurement changes the state of qubit, collasping the superposition
    - only 0 or 1, so measurement only returns one state
- would need to measure infinite number of qubits to determine $\alpha$ and $\beta$
  - how much information is represented by a qubit if we do not measure it? -> potential amount of "hidden information" grows exponentially with more qubits

*** 1.2.1: multiple qubits
- two qubits have four computational basis states:
  $$|\psi \rangle = \alpha_{00} | 00 \rangle + \alpha_{01} | 01 \rangle + \alpha_{10} | 10 \rangle + \alpha_{11} | 11 \rangle$$
- $\{0,1\}^2$: set of strings of length 2 with each letter either one or zero
- measuring the first qubit as 0 gives probability $|\alpha_{00}|^2 + |\alpha_{01}|^2$ and post-measurement state: $$|\psi ' \rangle = \frac{(\alpha_{00} | 00 \rangle + \alpha_{01} | 01 \rangle)} {\sqrt{|\alpha_{00}|^2 + |\alpha_{01}|^2)}}$$
- important two qubit state, Bell state or EPR pair: $$\frac{|00\rangle + |11 \rangle}{\sqrt{2}}$$
    - key ingredient in quantum teleportation and superdense coding
    - upon measuring first qubit, second qubit's value is correlated
- Bell: measurement correlations in Bell state are stronger than could ever exist between classical systems
- consider a system of $n$ qubits:
    - computational basis states: $$| x_1, x_2 ... x_n \rangle$$
    - quantum state is represented by $2^n$ amplitudes
      - amplitude, $$\alpha$$, is for $$\alpha|0\rangle$$

** 1.3 quantum computation
- changes occurring to a quantum state
- quantum circuit with quantum gates

*** single qubit gates
- quantum NOT gate: $$\alpha | 0 \rangle + \beta| 1 \rangle \rightarrow \alpha | 1 \rangle + \beta| 0 \rangle$$ it acts linearly
- nonlinear behaviour can lead to paradoxes
- NOT gate in matrix form

$$ X \equiv \begin{bmatrix}
0 & 1\\
1 & 0
\end{bmatrix}$$

- quantum state $$\alpha | 0 \rangle + \beta| 1 \rangle$$

$$ X \begin{bmatrix}
\alpha \\
\beta
\end{bmatrix} =
\begin{bmatrix}
\beta \\
\alpha
\end{bmatrix}$$

- single qubit quantum gates: two by two matrix
- quantum gate must still ensure the probabilities sum to 1
- the matrix $U$ representing the single qubit gate must be /unitary/: $$U^† U = I$$
  - $$U^†$$ is obtained by transposing then complex conjugating $U$
- any quantum gate must follow this unitarity constraint
- $Z$ gate: leaves $$|0\rangle$$ unchanged and flips sign of $$|1\rangle$$ to $$-|1\rangle$$

  $$ Z \equiv \begin{bmatrix}
  1 & 0 \\
  0 & -1
  \end{bmatrix}$$

- Hadamard gate, square root of NOT gate, but $$H^2 \neq$$ NOT:
  $$|0\rangle \rightarrow \tfrac{|0\rangle + |1\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}$$
  $$|1\rangle \rightarrow \tfrac{|0\rangle - |1\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}$$

  $$ H \equiv \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix}
  1 & 1 \\
  1 & -1
  \end{bmatrix}$$

- we can also decompose a single qubit gate into a product of rotations
    - can build up arbitrary single qubit gate using finite set of quantum gates
- an arbitrary quantum computation on any number of bits can be generated by a finite set of gates that is said to be universal for quantum computation

  [[../images/books/qc/hadamard.png]]

*** 1.3.2 multiple qubit gates
- controlled-NOT or CNOT gate
  - control qubit and targit qubit: $$|00\rangle \rightarrow |00\rangle; |01\rangle \rightarrow |01\rangle; |10\rangle \rightarrow |11\rangle; |11\rangle \rightarrow |10\rangle$$
  - generalized: $$|A,B\rangle \rightarrow |A, B \bigoplus A \rangle$$ the control qubit and targit qubit are XORED and stored in target

  $$ U_{CN} = \begin{bmatrix}
  1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
  0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
  0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
  0 & 0 & 1 & 0
  \end{bmatrix}$$

  - classical gates like NAND or XOR can't be understood as a unitary gate; these gates are irreversible or non-invertible
    - given output, cannot determine the input (a loss of information)
    - unitary quantum gates are always reversible -> quantum gate can always be inverted by another quantum gate (because of unitary)
- prototype gates (CNOT and single qubit gates): any multiple qubit logic gate can be composed from CNOT and single qubit gates


*** 1.3.3 measurement in bases other than computational basis
- given any basis states $$|a\rangle$$ and $$|b\rangle$$ for a qubit, it is possible to express an arbitrary state as linear combination $$\alpha|a\rangle + \beta|b\rangle$$
- if given states are orthonormal: possible to perform measurement with respect to $$|a\rangle$$,$$|b\rangle$$ basis with probabilities $$|\alpha|^2$$ and $$|\beta|^2$$
- formalism allows us to describe observed experimental results

*** 1.3.4 quantum circuits
- features in classical circuits not usually present in quantum circuits:
  - no loops, circuit is acyclic
  - no joining wires together (FANIN), resulting single wire containing bitwise OR of inputs
    - not reversible, not unitary
  - FANOUT: QM forbids copying of qubit
- controlled U Gate: suppose $U$ is a unitary matrix, define as a natural extension of controlled-NOT gate
    - single control qubit and $n$ target bits
- measurement: convert single qubit state into probabilisticclassical bit $M$

  [[../../../images/qc/measurement.png]]

*** 1.3.5 qubit copying circuit
- no cloning theorem:
  - can we create $$|\psi\rangle|\psi\rangle$$
    - once we measure one qubit, the state of the other is determined
    - measuring the first qubit loses the extra hidden information, but if we could make a copy then the second qubit still contains the extra hidden information -> therefore cannot create a copy

*** 1.3.6 example: bell states
1. Hadamard gate: puts top qubit in a superposition
2. CNOT: top qubit is control input
- transforms 4 computational basis states into Bell states
$$|\beta_{xy}\rangle = \frac{|0,y\rangle + (-1)^x |1,\bar{y}\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}$$


*** 1.3.7 example: quantum teleportation
- moving quantum states around, even in absence of channel
- A and B generate an EPR pair, and each one takes a qubit from EPR pair.
  - A wants to send a qubit $$|\psi\rangle$$ to B but does not know state of qubit and can only send classical information (A and B don't where each other are)
    - A doesn't know state of $$|\psi\rangle$$
    - describing $$|\psi\rangle$$ takes infinite amount of classical information because $$|\psi\rangle$$ takes values on continuous space
- use quantum teleportation:
  1. A interacts the $$|\psi\rangle$$ with half of the EPR pair -> 00,01,10,11
  2. B gets the two bits from A and can recover original state $$|\psi\rangle$$

[[../../../images/qc/qtransport.jpeg]]

- not faster than light due to need to transport two clasical bits using classical communication channel
- appears to create copy of quantum state being transported: only target qubit in state  $$|\psi\rangle$$ and original data qubit is a computational basis
- one shared EPR pair and two classical bits equal to one qubit

** 1.4 quantum algorithms
