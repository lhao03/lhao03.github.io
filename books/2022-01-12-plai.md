## preface

- programming languages are aggregates of features
- features interact in ways that may not be easy to predict
- while we progress across features, also want to study variation between them
- mystery language approach: with a fixed syntax, explore the different ways the same feature can behave
- programming languages thought of as abstract syntax tree -> program that processes this tree is recursive function

## evaluation

two types

- interpreter: consumes a program and simulates its execution.
  - interpreter:: Program -> Value
- compiler: consumes a program and produces another program
  - compiler:: Program_L -> Program_T

we have a choice:

eager
`(f (+ 5 4))`
`(f 9)`

or

lazy
`(f (+ 5 4))`
`(+ 1)` where `x` is replaced by `(+ 5 4)`

### substitution

- is generally slow

#### representing programs

- our evaluator comsumes programs
- surface syntax: how to represent a program (human POV)

### abstract syntax

- represent essence of the input, ignoring the superficial syntactic details
- in-computer representation of programs => AST, abstract syntax trees
- AST: tree-structured data that represent programs in programs
- by adopting a language's primitives, we inherit its semantics
