  <p>My choice to major in biochemistry and computer science is definitely unconventional. Even though there aren't many common courses between the two disciplines (except MATH 100/101/200 üò¢), I wouldn't have my major any other way. <span id="continue-reading"></span>  Since the seventh grade, I became obsessed with chemistry. For fun, I drew out my own periodic table and hung it on the wall in my room. In fact, that periodic table still hangs in my room. But how did I get started in computer science? </p>
<h2 id="a-sad-start">a sad start</h2>
<p>In high school, I joined the robotics team on a whim. When I learned that you had to use C++ to program the robot, I dropped out of the robotics team. I went back to my safe space - chemistry - and planned to major in chemistry. I've always been interested in chemistry at a young age; chemistry tinted the way I saw the world. Finding out that my eczema cream had steroids and how damaging steroids were, was because of chemistry. And reading about anammox bacteria (bacteria that oxidizes ammonium to dinitrogen gas using nitrite as the electron acceptor, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22103531/">source</a>) fascinated me. </p>
<h2 id="a-harsh-reality">a harsh reality</h2>
<p>But after I told my father I wanted to major in chemistry, he urged me to reconsider; the job market for chemistry graduates was slim. Since he was a software engineer, I decided that I'd try to pursue a computer science degree, a subject I had no prior knowledge of (except a glimpse of C++ from robotics). And that's how my journey in CS began.</p>
<h2 id="lost">lost</h2>
<p>Going into computer science, I felt like I didn't know what I didn't know. Thus, I felt very lost in my first year as a computer science major. And unfortunately, my exposure to computer science in high school was disappointing. I never saw computer science as anything interesting, and all the semi-colons and brackets scared me. At the time, programming didn't provide the stimulus that I felt when I drew out complicated organic chemistry structures or solved thermodynamic equations.</p>
<h2 id="biochemistry-x-computer-science">biochemistry x computer science</h2>
<p>Fortunately, my love of chemistry helped me solidify my choice to stay in computer science. I came across Open Chemistry on Github and was deeply intrigued. Eventually, I learned about other intersections of healthcare and technology from DeepMind's AlphaFold to virtual doctor visits; I saw how the intersection of computer science and healthcare could help society. Something I've never realized until now is that computer science could push society forward, but not on its own; it must require knowledge from many disciplines. Since I'm passionate about chemistry and healthcare,  I'm now majoring in computer science and minoring in biochemistry. </p>
<h2 id="now">now</h2>
<p>Currently, I'm a software developer intern at a biotechnology not-for-profit organization. In my role, I'm building a pipeline to automate the extraction of patient information from surgery reports. This position gives me a lot of pride because I believe my actions could one day contribute to a better surgeon experience and better patient experience.</p>
<p>I want young women (or anyone) to know pursuing computer science does not mean it's all or nothing. I encourage everyone to combine computer science with their other passions. Computer science reaches its potential when combined with other fields. I also want young women to know it's never too late to start in CS. It's never too late to learn.</p>
