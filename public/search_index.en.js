ramblings"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/33-percent/":{"body":"So what have I been up to these past four months?  A few things include:\n\nstarting my first internship\nhelping organize StarHacks\nTAing for the first time\nturning 20 (and still can't drive)\ndoing the most nerve wracking interview of my life\ndiscovering that I really like IU's songs\nfinishing up my one course (that I did well in!)\n\nBut that’s just the tip of the iceberg.\n🌟 StarHacks\nWhen I received an email saying that I was chosen to join the StarHacks team in September 2020 I was so excited. Until I saw what team I was on: outreach. Before we go any further, I’ll explain why I felt that way:\nIn high school, I took English IB. But I was horrible at english; after hours of tutoring, crying and revising, the highest mark I could muster on an essay was 75%. By some stroke of luck I scored a 6 on my English IB exams. However, after dealing with years of getting low marks from essays, it was ingrained into me that I was just bad at writing. Maybe I was only good at objective things like science and math. And I became okay with that. \nSo when I saw that bolded “Outreach” in the email, I was scared. Outreach is all about explaining your ideas to someone in order to convince them that you're worth listening to. Writing is exactly the same thing. How could someone like me be any good at outreach? For some unknown reason, I accepted the team invitation. \nAs the months went by, I realized that outreach wasn’t so bad. In fact, there is one thing I didn’t mention about the essays I wrote in english class. The essays that I got 75% on; well those were critical analytical essays in which we had to write about a novel or poem. When we got to write a personal essay about our life experiences, I scored 90% on those. And that’s what outreach soon began to feel like; writing a personal essay. \nYou see, StarHacks’ mission is to create a community for women and non-binary individuals in computer science. While I didn’t know it at the time, I'm exactly the same as all the girls who attended StarHacks; the girl who was scared of C++ and felt like dropping from the CS major in first year (you can read about that here). By writing newsletters, creating infographics and talking with these girls and non-binary individuals, I could encourage them to try out CS. And that to me, is the entire reason why I decided to join the StarHacks team. Since being a woman in STEM is a large part of my identity, outreach no longer was something I dreaded doing. In fact, I’m excited to be joining nwPlus as a marketing coordinator and I'm looking forward to the impact that I can make!\n👩🏻‍💻 Career\nThe weeks leading up to my first internship had me in a ball of nerves. Imposter syndrome struck hard and I couldn't stop thinking of thoughts like \"What if they regret hiring me?\" or \"What if I can't do anything?\". Fortunately, as I settled into my internship, I quickly forgot I had those thoughts in the first place! From learning all about biomedical text extraction, to even learning a bit about breast cancer, I've had a wonderful time at the PROOF Centre. I'll be writing a more in depth post about my first internship later!\n\nLess than one month into my internship, I got an email for a first round interview from a company. I nearly fell out of my chair and I ran to my father to show him the email. I was in disbelief, and after my shock wore off, I started to feel scared. This interview was for a software engineer position, so I knew there was going to be some leetcode style questions. And at the time I probably did less than 10 leetcode questions, so I got down to practicing my data structures and algorithms. Amazingly, I passed the first round of interviews and was invited for a final round of interviews! The final round of interviews included three 45 minute interviews with three different members at the company. I remember how exhausted I was when I finished my last interview and I just ended up staring at my laptop for the rest of the day. And to my shock, I received an email telling me that I had passed the final round of interviews! \nI have to thank my boyfriend, Ryan, and my friend Jacky, both of which helped me so much with preparation. Ryan would video call me for hours everyday to practice everything from my leetcoding to my behavioral questions. Jacky also freed up time in his very busy schedule to do some mock interviews with me. I can’t thank them enough! In the next few weeks you’ll see what this company is (I’m still in shock about getting an offer).\n🏋️‍♀️ Health and Fitness\nUnfortunately, not all was good. With an increasing workload, and my decision to work two jobs, I became much less active. I also started skipping meals and working out on an empty stomach. Due to my eating disorder, I've developed digestive issues, so skipping meals caused me alot of stomach pain. \nIt's also been a year since I lifted anything heavier than 50 lbs. And I'm going insane. The gym has always been a place for me to zone out, but being at home makes that alot harder. With a lack of equipment, working out just didn't seem fun anymore. Since I could just run upstairs if I got an email from work, working out was no longer me time, but something I did to make sure I got in my daily exercise.\nAfter realizing how unfit I had gotten, I did the unthinkable; I started to run again. I quit cross country in high school and never looked back, so running was something that I didn't think I'd ever do again; at least not everyday. For the past month I've been running anywhere from 20 to 40 mins a day, along with some calisthenics. And I feel better. Running is no substitute for weight lifting, but running allows me to zone out and ignore the world for awhile. \n\n\nA typical monday to friday.\nWhile physical health and nutrition is super important to me, my eye health and brain health is easily left on the back burner. I've had days where my eyes are so sore I have to pause every few minutes to just close them. Being nearsighted doesn't make my horrible eye health any better. I hope to start implementing some healthy eye habits because I really do take my eyes for granted.\n🤔 Life\nDespite being 20, I still feel like the 18 year old who just finished high school. I still can't drive, have never tried alcohol and live at home (thought I don't mind this one too much). Some of that can be attributed to the pandemic. While the pandemic sucks, I've gotten into the habit of having friendly debates with my dad, running terminal commands on my brother's laptop to look cool 😎, and more chats with my mom. And I'm very grateful for that.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/33-percent/","title":"🤔 1/3 of 2021"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/cool-blogs/":{"body":"In my free time, I've found some really cool people and their blogs:\n\nPaulette Koronkevich\nJean Yang, and her website\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/cool-blogs/","title":"✍ Some cool blogs"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/course-review/":{"body":"As a computer science student minoring in biochemistry, you can expect me to have taken a wide range of courses from data structures and algorithms to environmental microbiology. So I thought, hey, let's review some courses! \n\nComputer Science\nCPSC 110 🐄\nAt UBC, this is one of the first computer science courses you need to take to be admitted into the computer science program, regardless of faculty. I think it is one of the hardest and most eye-opening computer science courses I've ever taken. Firstly, the course uses Racket, a programming language based on Scheme, that most people have never heard of before. (This is a good thing about the course - you're not at a disadvantage if you have never programmed before. Then you're taught to use design recipes. Sticking to a general template helps out with planning out solutions to those infamous Leetcode problems! And then finally, you must trust the natural recursion. Having learned about recursion in my first year made implementing recursion in CPSC 221 a breeze! And of course, Gregor makes sure you eat, sleep, and breathe recursion 🐄.\nWould I recommend this course? Yes!\nWhat I enjoyed about the course: Gregor makes you focus on problem-solving rather than learning a specific programming language.\nCPSC 121\nThis course is the second required course you need must take to apply to the computer science major at UBC. At its core, CPSC 121 is an introductory proof and logic course with circuits thrown in for good measure. Most high school students have never been exposed to the content in CPSC 121 - in CPSC 121 you must think about the why vs. the how. I usually never use office hours, but for this course I did! The assignments can be challenging, but it also feels really good to churn out a proof by induction. My advice is to keep on top of your textbook readings and use those office hours!\nWould I recommend this course? Yes!\nWhat I love about the course: Learning about proofs, logic and circuits can throw you into a new way of thinking that is typically not taught in high school, which is important for computer science.\nCPSC 210\nI found this course one of the easiest computer science courses I've taken so far as a computer science student. This course is all about Java, OOP, and design patterns! This is also the first course that has a large project associated with it. The project requirements aren't that hard, but anything becomes hard if you don't have enough time to do it. This course uses the same video platform that CPSC 110 did. I liked drawing out relationships between classes, objects, and methods to understand what was going on. I'm also currently a teaching assistant for this course, so hit me up if you are in this course and need help. \nWould I recommend this course? Yes.\nWhat I love about the course: The content in this computer science course is super important to writing good code. Design patterns are also super cool to learn about (they are used a lot in Android development if you're interested in that.)\nCPSC 221\nThis course is pretty much your standard data structures and algorithms courses. As someone who is not very good with this stuff, I found this course difficult at times (not to mention, it's taught in C++). And always remember to deallocate your pointers when you are done using them. Wait, what's a pointer again...\nWould I recommend? Yes!\nWhat I love about the course: Understanding data structures and algorithms is not essential to writing code, but it is essential to writing good code, especially if you decide to dive into lower-level computer stuff (it's also pretty important information for those technical interviews). So make sure you pay attention in this course!\n\nMathematics\nMATH 100\nJust your basic first-year university differential calculus course. But this course is nothing like high school calculus. Just because you got 100 in high school calculus does not mean you can ace this course. Always attend lectures, do textbook questions, and attend office hours. Unfortunately, I never attended office hours and MATH 100 is one of my lowest marks. MATH 100 is also the hardest version of first-year calculus, but if you're interested in higher-level physics/maths/chemistry courses you should take MATH 100, as you can expect this level of math in these higher-level physics/maths/chemistry courses. \nWould I recommend? Yes.\nWhat I love about the course: You don't need to remember this level of math to be a software engineer, but MATH 100 has many applications in other courses like physics and chemistry. \nMATH 101\nJust your basic first-year integral calculus course. I had the same thoughts on this course as I did for MATH 100.\nWould I recommend? Yes.\nWhat I love about the course: Same points as for MATH 100.\nSTAT 251\nThere's not much to say about this course. It's a pretty standard statistics course that teaches you about all the different types of distributions, conditional probability, and more. Make sure you're caught up on the textbook readings and questions and you won't have too much trouble with this course.\nWould I recommend? Meh\nWhat I love about the course: This is pretty standard statistics that you can find in an IB textbook, so I think you could also teach yourself this content. \n\nChemistry\nCHEM 123 (130)\nIf you have taken chemistry IB HL, this course will be a breeze for you. I took this course during the summer of COVID 19, so it was all online. This course comes with a VERY USEFUL course notebook. I still use that course notebook in my other chemistry and biology courses.\nWould I recommend? Yes!\nWhat I love about the course: It goes over a wide range of topics from thermodynamics, acid and base chemistry, and of course organic chemistry. It gives a nice review for those who took IBHL chemistry.\nCHEM 233\nSince I'm not a chemistry major 😭, this was the only organic chemistry course I was able to register for. I attended Jay's lectures, even though I wasn't registered for his class. Sadly, Jay will not be able to make any more T***p jokes. Lots and lots and lots of reaction pathways. Cheatsheets are your friend in this course. Also don't rely on your cheatsheets, they should only be used to confirm what you know. You should have nearly all the reaction pathways memorized. (I'm not sure if you will be allowed cheatsheets in person, so just memorize the pathways). But note that you can't just memorize the pathways, as you might need to use a combination of pathways to reach an end product. You should view these problems like puzzles and the general pathways as puzzle pieces. Make sure to stay on top of problem sets and attend office hours. \nWould I recommend? Yes! But only if you really really like organic chemistry.\nWhat I love about the course: It's all about organic chemistry! \n\nBiology\nBIOL 112\nI took this introductory biology course in the summer of COVID 19, so it was all online. Having not taken Biology 30 (grade 12), I found this course pretty manageable. If you remember your grade 12 biology you will be set.\nWould I recommend? Yes!\nWhat I love about the course: Also a nice review of grade 12 biology. I don't think anything new was introduced though.\nBIOL 200\nThis course helped me appreciate the biology of our body! My instructor, Vivienne, made the course engaging and taught the content in a fun and effective way. She also let us stamp and draw all over her zoom slides. Despite the course being all online, Vivienne made sure that we had many chances to engage with herself and the other students. Also, the course content is super interesting and helped me reinforce concepts I learned in MICB 202. Exams are mostly long answers based on data such as microscope images and experiments like DNA electrophoresis and SDS-PAGE.\nWould I recommend? Yes!\nWhat I love about the course: The course gets deep into what's happening inside of our cells. Here's a funny video: https://youtu.be/eEFyPbsXdN0. I promise it's worth it! \n\nMicrobiology\nMICB 201\nI have strong words to say about this course. The content is really interesting for sure, but the way this course was delivered during the pandemic made it hard for me to learn the content. \nSome people think prerecorded lectures are the holy grail. Unfortunately, prerecorded lectures take forever for me to watch. A one-hour recorded lecture always turns into a three-hour lecture. Additionally, we were given 20-page readings per week and we had 6ish quizzes making up our entire mark (which I failed at least one). The quiz and final questions were ambiguous and very unforgiving. This course was essentially converted into distance learning, which I've had a horrible experience with in the past.\nWould I recommend? No :( Not online at least.\nWhy I regret taking this course: There is no engagement with the professor and lots and lots of memorization of content. \nMICB 202\nOne of the most interesting courses I've taken at UBC. The instructors were so forgiving during the pandemic and they worked hard to create unique and fun assignments. We learned about the immune system, viruses, and bacterial diseases, which is pretty fitting for right now. The instructors were also knowledgeable about their topics at hand and I highly recommend this course to anyone interested in their immune system and viruses. Exam questions were very fair and we even had an assignment in which we were given a mystery virus and tasked to find which known virus it was most similar with. \nWould I recommend? Yes!\nWhat I love about the course: While this course is also a lot of memorization of content the instructors were very understanding of student's circumstances and worked hard on creating super engaging and interesting assignments.\nMisc.\nATSC 113\nEasy booster but if you don't enjoy memorizing sentence after sentence after sentence, then this course will be a bore for you. I hated this course so much by the end. The easy booster mark was not worth the boredom and money.\nWould I recommend? No :(\nWhy I regret taking this course: If you love going hiking, skiing, etc, this course may be for you. Unfortunately for me, I do none of those activities, so I've forgotten all the content from this course. Additionally, I don't do well with memorization heavy courses. This course being distance learning made it much worse.\nDSCI 100\nI took the second iteration of this course, and I could tell the instructors worked hard to create a well-rounded syllabus. We used R in this course to do a lot of data analysis. The instructors also created their textbooks and interactive labs. There is also a final project associated with this course in which you choose a piece of data to analyze. The exams were all online and tested concepts and coding in R.\nWould I recommend? Yes!\nWhat I love about the course: I highly recommend this course if you are someone from a non-coding background interested in data science, but those who can already code should also take this course if you are interested in data science. \n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/course-review/","title":"📚 Course Review"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/cs-bchem/":{"body":"My choice to major in biochemistry and computer science is definitely unconventional. Even though there aren't many common courses between the two disciplines (except MATH 100/101/200 😢), I wouldn't have my major any other way.   Since the seventh grade, I became obsessed with chemistry. For fun, I drew out my own periodic table and hung it on the wall in my room. In fact, that periodic table still hangs in my room. But how did I get started in computer science? \na sad start\nIn high school, I joined the robotics team on a whim. When I learned that you had to use C++ to program the robot, I dropped out of the robotics team. I went back to my safe space - chemistry - and planned to major in chemistry. I've always been interested in chemistry at a young age; chemistry tinted the way I saw the world. Finding out that my eczema cream had steroids and how damaging steroids were, was because of chemistry. And reading about anammox bacteria (bacteria that oxidizes ammonium to dinitrogen gas using nitrite as the electron acceptor, source) fascinated me. \na harsh reality\nBut after I told my father I wanted to major in chemistry, he urged me to reconsider; the job market for chemistry graduates was slim. Since he was a software engineer, I decided that I'd try to pursue a computer science degree, a subject I had no prior knowledge of (except a glimpse of C++ from robotics). And that's how my journey in CS began.\nlost\nGoing into computer science, I felt like I didn't know what I didn't know. Thus, I felt very lost in my first year as a computer science major. And unfortunately, my exposure to computer science in high school was disappointing. I never saw computer science as anything interesting, and all the semi-colons and brackets scared me. At the time, programming didn't provide the stimulus that I felt when I drew out complicated organic chemistry structures or solved thermodynamic equations.\nbiochemistry x computer science\nFortunately, my love of chemistry helped me solidify my choice to stay in computer science. I came across Open Chemistry on Github and was deeply intrigued. Eventually, I learned about other intersections of healthcare and technology from DeepMind's AlphaFold to virtual doctor visits; I saw how the intersection of computer science and healthcare could help society. Something I've never realized until now is that computer science could push society forward, but not on its own; it must require knowledge from many disciplines. Since I'm passionate about chemistry and healthcare,  I'm now majoring in computer science and minoring in biochemistry. \nnow\nCurrently, I'm a software developer intern at a biotechnology not-for-profit organization. In my role, I'm building a pipeline to automate the extraction of patient information from surgery reports. This position gives me a lot of pride because I believe my actions could one day contribute to a better surgeon experience and better patient experience.\nI want young women (or anyone) to know pursuing computer science does not mean it's all or nothing. I encourage everyone to combine computer science with their other passions. Computer science reaches its potential when combined with other fields. I also want young women to know it's never too late to start in CS. It's never too late to learn.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/cs-bchem/","title":"🧬 Why Biochemistry and Computer Science?"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/first/":{"body":"Hello!

If so, don't waste all your hard work! Now as a second-year student at UBC, I’ll now tell you how doing IB has impacted me and the mistakes I’ve made in choosing my courses as a first-year student.\n\nIntroduction to the IB\nIf you have never heard of the IB program, here's a brief explanation from the Calgary Board of Education: \n\nThe IB programme is an internationally recognized enrichment option for high school students. The program develops \"internationally minded people, who recognizing their common humanity and shared guardianship of the planet, help to create a better and more peaceful world\" (IB mission).\n\n\nThe programme encourages participation in creative and service-oriented actions, as well as personal and academic reflection, addresses intellectual, social, emotional and physical well-being and covers the curriculum required by Alberta Education and the IB programme.\n\nIn the IB programme, there are two levels of courses you can take: standard level (SL) and higher level (HL). Most SL courses cover your standard curriculum while HL courses cover some first-year university content. You must take 3 HL courses and up to 4 and then the remaining courses being SL courses. That is of course for full IB students - you take 6 courses total. Of those 6 courses, you must take one language, two sciences, literature, history, and math (at my high school). Full IB students must also take a Theory of Knowledge Course and submit an Extended Essay.\nThere are also partial IB students who just take a few courses (at least one humanity and one science/math at my high school). They do not need to take a Theory of Knowledge Course or submit an Extended Essay. \nThis guide will be most aligned with students interested in computer science! But you can general points in the TLDR. \nI took: \n\nChemistry HL, English Literature HL, History HL\nPhysics SL, Mandarin SL, Mathematics SL\n\nI’ll go into deeper detail about each course and the impact it has had on my two years at UBC.\nCourses I'm glad I took: \n\nChemistry HL\nEnglish Literature HL\nHistory HL\nTheory of Knowledge\nPhysics SL → I don't regret taking Physics SL, but I would have liked to take Physics HL (however I would take Mathematics HL over Physics HL, and that's why Physics SL is here).\n\nCourses I regret taking (and what I would replace them with):\n\nMandarin Ab Initio → literally any other language\nMathematics SL → Mathematics HL\n\nChemistry HL\nBy taking Chemistry HL, you can fulfill the lab and science requirements for the BSc. Additionally, if you are planning to major in life sciences, taking Chemistry HL will help you prepare for the university-level chemistry content, which is very different from what you learn in high school. With my credit from Chemistry HL, I skipped CHEM 121 and I went straight into CHEM 123, which was a breeze for me.\nEnglish Literature HL\nFor many people, English can be a demanding course, which can have the negative effect of also lowering your GPA. If you take English Literature HL you can skip 6 credits of the first year ENGL courses - that's your comminations requirement. For this meant I did not do any ENGL courses in university!\nHistory HL\nAs a BSc. student you need 12 art credits in addition to communications courses. Since I took History HL, I got 6 credits worth of HIST courses - that's already half of your required arts credits! \nPhysics SL\nI got 3 credits for PHYS 100, but I didn't need credits for PHYS 100. I would have preferred not to get credit for PHYS 100, but UBC takes all your transfer credit for IB or none. The 3 credits added towards my total credits taken which you can read about here. If you took Physics HL, then you would be able to replace PHYS 100 (3) and PHYS 1st-year level (3), with exemption from PHYS 101, which would also complete your lab requirements and allow you to register for higher-level physics courses. \nMandarin Ab Initio\nThis is more of a personal reason for me. I'm pretty white-washed, so I speak Mandarin at the level of a preschooler. But the thing is, teaching Mandarin at the high school level is just really hard for me. I wish I choose a language that used the alphabet instead, as I just couldn't grasp Mandarin fast enough. I still speak Mandarin at the level of a preschooler. You don't get any credit for taking an ab initio language.\nMathematics SL\nThis is probably the course I almost wish I took at the HL level. Math HL teaches you how to write proofs, which is something the standard high school curriculum is missing. Knowing how to write proofs gives you a leg up as a math or computer science student. Additionally, you can skip MATH 100 and MATH 101, and go straight into MATH 200 and MATH 221 (for computer science students)! But be warned that MATH HL is no easy feat. If you decide to take MATH HL you will need to put in the work. You don't get any credit for taking Mathematics SL. \nTheory of Knowledge\nFor full IB students, we are required to write a TOK Essay. You can read about that here: http://www.howtoib.com/writing-tok-essays/. I think TOK essays are super interesting, and if you get above a B on your essay, you can get transfer credit for 6 credits worth of PHIL courses. And with those 6 credits, I was already done my arts requirements as a BSc. student. \n\nOverall\nDue to my choices, I took only 7 courses in my first year. But even with such a light load, I was already done my arts requirements, lab requirement, and communications requirements. The downside to taking IB courses is that you can go over your credit limit(48, I think I had 47) due to transfer credits, which means you could not be able to be promoted to the second year. You can read more about that here: https://science.ubc.ca/students/requirements/promotion. \nHowever, make sure to check your university's policy on IB credits. UBC allows you to use all of your IB courses for transfer credit, whereas U of Waterloo has limits. But make sure you realize the hard work you will have to put in if you decide to choose HL courses. You are learning standard high school and first-year university content at the same time that other students are learning just the standard high school content. IB courses, whether they are SL or HL, also require IA (internal assessments) which are research-like papers.\nAm I glad I took IB? Of course! If I were given the chance to do high school again I would choose to do IB.\nTLDR\nCheck here for all the credits you can get for your IB courses: https://you.ubc.ca/applying-ubc/applied/first-year-credit/\nYou're a student who does not to want to take any arts electives:\n\nTake History HL, English Literature HL, any HL language course.\nIf you are a full IB student, score well on your Theory of Knowledge essay (at least a B) and you can get 6 philosophy credits (that's two courses).\nIf you're a BSc. you will have fulfilled all your arts requirements (including communications)\n\nYou're a student who does not to want to take any science electives:\n\nTaky any HL science in high school and you will get at least 3/4 credits if you score well on your IB exams!\n\nYou're a student is okay with arts electives, but you don't want English to drag down your GPA:\n\nTake English Literature HL or English Language and Literature HL. As a BSc. student you will have fulfilled your communications requirement. \n\nYou're a student who does not want to take any science electives with a lab components:\n\nTake Physics HL, Chemistry HL or Biology HL in high school and you won't need to do a lab science in uni!\n\nYou're a student who loves X (and you want to get straight into the higher level X courses):\n\nTake the HL version of X and you will be able to register into second year courses!\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/ib/","title":"🎓 My experience at UBC as an IB Diploma graduate"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/ta/":{"body":"Tomorrow will be the last time I mark exams as a first-time TA while blasting kpop and eating dark chocolate. And I'm going to document some thoughts now from the perspective of a first time TA.\n\nI'm writing this blog post at the end of a very exhausting day. Currently, I am TA for CPSC 210, Software Construction, a course that teaches all things related to OOP and test driven design. Now having experienced the course as a student and TA, I wanted to document some things I've felt during my first time as a TA.\nwe are human too\nFirstly, we are human too! We have all have jobs, courses, and a life to live. I'd be lying if I told you I answered every student's email the moment I received it. If I don't immediately answer a student's question it's usually because I'm in a bad mood, or I'm doing some research on your question to better answer you. In both cases, I'm making sure you receive the best answer from me. You wouldn't want me to answer your question when I'm tired and I wouldn't want to have you a half-assed answer either.\nSince us TAs are also human, we also make mistakes. This term I accidentally put 10 when I meant 100 and I never realized I made this mistake until my student asked why they had a 10% on a lab when the Autobot clearly said 100%! If you think there's a mistake, please tell me! Most of the time I'm inputting grades in a hurry so I'm not always double-checking. It's also lot harder to debug code in a virtual setting so let's be patient with each other!\ni'm probably as nervous as you\nSecondly, I'm nervous too! Maybe you feel nervous about asking a question, well I am equally nervous to answer your questions. Some days I feel less nervous, while other days I'm shaking in my chair while talking (thanks imposter syndrome). And don't feel bad for not knowing something, because sometimes I don't know either!\nsaying hi is awesome :D\nAnd thirdly, thank you to the students who give a quick hello to me, start up a small convo and students who just see me as a person too!
