A few things include:\n\nstarting my first internship\nhelping organize StarHacks\nTAing for the first time\nturning 20 (and still can't drive)\ndoing the most nerve wracking interview of my life\ndiscovering that I really like IU's songs\nfinishing up my one course (that I did well in!)\n\nBut that’s just the tip of the iceberg.\n🌟 StarHacks\nWhen I received an email saying that I was chosen to join the StarHacks team in September 2020 I was so excited. Until I saw what team I was on: outreach. Before we go any further, I’ll explain why I felt that way:\nIn high school, I took English IB. But I was horrible at English; after hours of tutoring, crying and revising, the highest mark I could muster on an essay was 75%. By some stroke of luck I scored a 6 on my English IB exams. However, after dealing with years of getting low marks from essays, it was ingrained into me that I was just bad at writing. Maybe I was only good at objective things like science and math. And I became okay with that. \nSo when I saw that bolded “Outreach” in the email, I was scared. Outreach is all about explaining your ideas to someone in order to convince them that you're worth listening to. Writing is exactly the same thing. How could someone like me be any good at outreach? For some unknown reason, I accepted the team invitation. \nAs the months went by, I realized that outreach wasn’t so bad. In fact, there is one thing I didn’t mention about the essays I wrote in English class. The essays that I got 75% on; well those were critical analytical essays in which we had to write about a novel or poem. When we got to write a personal essay about our life experiences, I scored 90% on those. And that’s what outreach soon began to feel like; writing a personal essay. \nYou see, StarHacks’ mission is to create a community for women and non-binary individuals in computer science. While I didn’t know it at the time, I'm exactly the same as all the girls who attended StarHacks; the girl who was scared of C++ and felt like dropping from the CS major in first year (you can read about that here). By writing newsletters, creating infographics and talking with these girls and non-binary individuals, I could encourage them to try out CS. And that to me, is the entire reason why I decided to join the StarHacks team. Since being a woman in STEM is a large part of my identity, outreach no longer was something I dreaded doing. In fact, I’m excited to be joining nwPlus as a marketing coordinator and I'm looking forward to the impact that I can make!\n👩🏻‍💻 Career\nThe weeks leading up to my first co-op had me in a ball of nerves. Imposter syndrome struck hard and I couldn't stop thinking of thoughts like \"What if they regret hiring me?\" or \"What if I can't do anything?\". Fortunately, as I settled into my internship, I quickly forgot I had those thoughts in the first place! From learning all about biomedical text extraction, to even learning a bit about breast cancer, I've had a wonderful time at the PROOF Centre. You can read about that here.\n\nLess than one month into my internship, I got an email for a first round interview from a company. I nearly fell out of my chair and I ran to my father to show him the email. I was in disbelief, and after my shock wore off, I started to feel scared. This interview was for a software engineer position, so I knew there was going to be some leetcode style questions. And at the time I probably did less than 10 leetcode questions, so I got down to practicing my data structures and algorithms. Amazingly, I passed the first round of interviews and was invited for a final round of interviews! The final round of interviews included three 45 minute interviews with three different members at the company. I remember how exhausted I was when I finished my last interview and I just ended up staring at my laptop for the rest of the day. And to my shock, I received an email telling me that I had passed the final round of interviews! \nI have to thank my boyfriend, Ryan, and my friend Jacky, both of which helped me so much with preparation. Ryan would video call me for hours everyday to practice everything from my leetcoding to my behavioral questions. Jacky also freed up time in his very busy schedule to do some mock interviews with me. I can’t thank them enough! In the next few weeks you’ll see what this company is (I’m still in shock about getting an offer).\n🏋️‍♀️ Health and Fitness\nUnfortunately, not all was good. With an increasing workload, and my decision to work two jobs, I became much less active. I also started skipping meals and working out on an empty stomach. Due to my eating disorder, I've developed digestive issues, so skipping meals caused me alot of stomach pain. \nIt's also been a year since I lifted anything heavier than 50 lbs. And I'm going insane. The gym has always been a place for me to zone out, but being at home makes that a lot harder. With a lack of equipment, working out just didn't seem fun anymore. Since I could just run upstairs if I got an email from work, working out was no longer me time, but something I did to make sure I got in my daily exercise.\nAfter realizing how unfit I had gotten, I did the unthinkable; I started to run again. I quit cross country in high school and never looked back, so running was something that I didn't think I'd ever do again; at least not everyday. For the past month I've been running anywhere from 20 to 40 mins a day, along with some calisthenics. And I feel better. Running is no substitute for weight lifting, but running allows me to zone out and ignore the world for awhile. \n\n\nA typical Monday to Friday.\nWhile physical health and nutrition is super important to me, my eye health and brain health is easily left on the back burner. I've had days where my eyes are so sore I have to pause every few minutes to just close them. Being nearsighted doesn't make my horrible eye health any better. I hope to start implementing some healthy eye habits because I really do take my eyes for granted.\n🤔 Life\nDespite being 20, I still feel like the 18 year old who just finished high school. I still can't drive, have never tried alcohol and live at home (thought I don't mind this one too much). Some of that can be attributed to the pandemic. While the pandemic sucks, I've gotten into the habit of having friendly debates with my dad, running terminal commands on my brother's laptop to look cool 😎, and more chats with my mom. And I'm very grateful for that.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/33-percent/","title":"🤔 1/3 of 2021"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/computer-bio-virus/":{"body":"Taking CPSC 213 and MICB 306 together made me start wondering about the parallels between computer viruses and biological viruses. \nFirstly, a biological virus causes havoc by replicating it's genome, which means it tries to make our cells translate it's RNA (genome) over our RNA or alongside our RNA. RNA is a just a set of instructions telling the cell how to make proteins. This is very similar to computer viruses; computer viruses try to run their code either alongside the \"good\" code or also tries to block execution of the \"good\" code. Code is also a set of instructions telling the computer what to do. \nSecondly, a difference, is that I don't think computer viruses can evolve or mutate (?), probably because computers are not really prone to making mistakes and there isn't a need to change a working computer virus. Something like a polymorphic virus seems like a mutating virus, but it's function doesn't change. On the other hand, translating RNA is more error prone then translating DNA, and virions are competing for resources and have to assemble properly before being released, so they are prone to the chemistry, physics and biology at that moment in time. So you could get a different virus strain upon releasing the new virons, though that new strain is not always more infectious. \nAnother thing that's really interesting is how viruses can rearrange parts of your cell. HCV creates membranous webs, completely rearranging your ER to its liking. Kinda like corrupting the memory of your computer. \nIt's quite interesting how a piece of code or piece of RNA could cause so much damage. \n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/computer-bio-virus/","title":"💻 Computers Viruses and Biological Viruses"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/cool-blogs/":{"body":"In my free time, I've found some really cool people and their blogs:\n\nPaulette Koronkevich\nJean Yang, and her website\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/cool-blogs/","title":"✍ Some cool blogs"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/course-planning/":{"body":"year 3\nTerm 1Term 2\nComputer ScienceMATH 200, CPSC 320, CPSC 213CPSC 313, MICB 308\nBiochemistryBIOC 202, MICB 306FRST 302, CHEM 213\n\nyear 4\nTerm 1Term 2\nComputer ScienceCPSC 310, CPSC 311, MATH 221CPSC 411, CPSC 421, CPSC 312\nBiochemistryBIOC 303BIOC 303, BIOL 335\n\nyear 5\nTerm 1Term 2\nComputer ScienceCPSC 410, CPSC XXX, CPSC 317CPSC XXX, CPSC 421, CPSC 416, CPSC XXX\nBiochemistryBIOC 402, BIOC 410\n\nbiochemistry minor requirements\nIn general the Biochemistry Minor consists of all of BIOC 303, 402, and 410; and 6 credits selected, in consultation with the Biochemistry advisor, from: BIOC 403, 440, 450, 460; BIOL 335; CHEM 305, 313; MICB 302, 306, 325, 405, 425.

Even though there aren't many common courses between the two disciplines (except MATH 100/101/200 😢), I wouldn't have my major any other way.   Since the seventh grade, I became obsessed with chemistry. For fun, I drew out my own periodic table and hung it on the wall in my room. In fact, that periodic table still hangs in my room. But how did I get started in computer science? \na sad start\nIn high school, I joined the robotics team on a whim. When I learned that you had to use C++ to program the robot, I dropped out of the robotics team. I went back to my safe space - chemistry - and planned to major in chemistry. I've always been interested in chemistry at a young age; chemistry tinted the way I saw the world. Finding out that my eczema cream had steroids and how damaging steroids were, was because of chemistry. And reading about anammox bacteria (bacteria that oxidizes ammonium to dinitrogen gas using nitrite as the electron acceptor, source) fascinated me. \na harsh reality\nBut after I told my father I wanted to major in chemistry, he urged me to reconsider; the job market for chemistry graduates was slim. Since he was a software engineer, I decided that I'd try to pursue a computer science degree, a subject I had no prior knowledge of (except a glimpse of C++ from robotics). And that's how my journey in CS began.\nlost\nGoing into computer science, I felt like I didn't know what I didn't know. Thus, I felt very lost in my first year as a computer science major. And unfortunately, my exposure to computer science in high school was disappointing. I never saw computer science as anything interesting, and all the semi-colons and brackets scared me. At the time, programming didn't provide the stimulus that I felt when I drew out complicated organic chemistry structures or solved thermodynamic equations.\nbiochemistry x computer science\nFortunately, my love of chemistry helped me solidify my choice to stay in computer science. I came across Open Chemistry on GitHub and was deeply intrigued. Eventually, I learned about other intersections of healthcare and technology from DeepMind's AlphaFold to virtual doctor visits; I saw how the intersection of computer science and healthcare could help society. Something I've never realized until now is that computer science could push society forward, but not on its own; it must require knowledge from many disciplines. Since I'm passionate about chemistry and healthcare,  I'm now majoring in computer science and minoring in biochemistry. \nnow\nCurrently, I'm a software developer intern at a biotechnology not-for-profit organization. In my role, I'm building a pipeline to automate the extraction of patient information from surgery reports. This position gives me a lot of pride because I believe my actions could one day contribute to a better surgeon experience and better patient experience.\nI want young women (or anyone) to know pursuing computer science does not mean it's all or nothing. I encourage everyone to combine computer science with their other passions. Computer science reaches its potential when combined with other fields. I also want young women to know it's never too late to start in CS. It's never too late to learn.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/cs-bchem/","title":"🧬 Why Biochemistry and Computer Science?"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/do-good-explanations-have-to-be-true/":{"body":"\nThis is my Theory of Knowledge Essay with a few edits. Please don't plagiarize my essay.\n\nFrom a young age, humans are curious beings; the simple question of \"why\" is perhaps the question parents hear most from their toddlers. And when we got explanations to our \"why?\", we mostly assumed what a superior told us was “true”; correct and in accordance with. However, as I got older and learned more things, I realized not everything told to me was true (in fact, sometimes quite wrong). I wondered, if something untrue, was still beneficial to my advancement of knowledge. However, I have come to realise that good explanations - that allow for a majority of society to understand a concept, without the need for specialized knowledge - should not be judged on their validity in determining their value. In the Natural Sciences and Religious Knowledge Systems, explanations do not have to be 100% true to provide good and sometimes better explanations (than true explanations). Thus, to what extent do Natural Sciences and Religious Knowledge Systems have to be based on true explanations to be good? I believe to a certain extent that the validity, or trueness, of an explanation is important; however, whether it is true or not should not determine if an explanation is good, rather how the explanation benefits society, and sometimes, this occurs when explanations are not entirely true. \nScience\nThe Acid/Base Theory\n\nIn the Natural Sciences, there are many complex phenomenons that are quite difficult to actually understand. Thus, to what extent can imagination be used to understand and teach complex scientific phenomenon? Such an example of this occurred in in my Chemistry IBHL class. When I first learned about acids and bases in junior high, I was taught the Bronsted Lowry theory of acids and bases, and used my imagination to picture the acid giving off a hydrogen ion to the base. This imagination aided me throughout high school. However, I later learned about Lewis theory, which explains that the base gives off a pair of electrons to the acid; an almost 180 degree flip from the Bronsted Lowry theory! Although the Bronsted Lowry theory is not true, I still use the theory to this day in modeling acid/base behaviours; for instance, in my biochemistry class we model amino acids with or without hydrogen atoms based on the pH. In our modern age, the world continually progresses; thus, knowledge in every discipline continually evolves, with Natural Sciences at the forefront of this everyday change. However, the discoveries that scientists make usually requires a great deal of knowledge to understand, knowledge much of society does not have the time or privilege to possess. Thus, through imagination, explanations in science can still be good, without being true. And often, these basic, but not entirely true explanations, serve their purpose in regular life. Complexity is not necessary everywhere in life, and sometimes, a general understanding of certain topics is all that is needed. \nThe Atomic Model\n\nA counterclaim I will now examine centers around the theories of the model of the atom. When I first learned Dalton’s billiard ball model in grade 10, it was quite easy to see that this model was wrong. Then I learned Bohr's model. Simply put, it describes electrons orbiting around a central positively charged center. I've probably drawn hundreds of these Bohr models for the first three rows of elements in the periodic table. However, in my chemistry HL class, I learned about the quantum mechanical model of the atom: this theory states that there is an electron cloud surrounding a positively charged nucleus, with some areas having a higher density of electrons. Electrons move in random motion, none of that orbit stuff. Did that mean I didn't even need to draw all those Bohr models? After learning about various atomic models, one may argue how close we can get to the “most true” answer is the whole purpose of science, and that a wrong explanation is simply useless to society because it contains a fallacy, seen clearly with the inaccuracies of the Dalton and Bohr model. Thus, these \"outdated\" theories should no longer be taught. However, providing complex explanations, such as the Schrödinger’s quantum model, which some may find hard to understand, is not always the best way to explain something. To visually understand that Boron has 5 electrons, should we explain the quantum mechanical model to someone in junior high? Does it add value to the 10th grader's understanding to tell them that the first two electrons are in 1s, the second two electrons are in 2s, and the last electron is in 2p? Or does the Bohr model suffice? Only a few individuals possess the knowledge to understand such theories: these “true” theories that are full of complicated mathematics. This would destroy the whole purpose of scientific exploration because if people do not embrace new discoveries, hard work goes to waste; the Bohr model, can provides a good explanation for someone who does not need to understand why an electron in 2s behaves differently in 3s in their everyday life. Thus, in the case of Natural Sciences, I believe that good explanations do not always have to be true. In fact, they may contain errors, yet still serve the purpose of providing scientific knowledge to everyone in society. \nReligon\nAnother Area of Knowledge I will examine is Religious Knowledge Systems. Religion is mostly based on explanations from texts and oral teachings, such as the Holy Bible in Christianity. I myself have been educated in a Western Catholic school system which regards the Bible as a historical text. However in the Bible, there are many fantastical events that simply would require magic (or something like that) to occur in today’s society. Thus, to what extent can reasoning dispute that religious explanations have to be true to be good?  Although some biblical stories are realistic, some stories contain  inconsistencies. Many of us would use our knowledge, and reason that if the creation story were true, that all of the world's population would be born by incest, because God only put two individuals on earth. Thus, in the case of religion, reasoning invites the idea that true explanations are not necessarily the best. By viewing the Bible as an allegory or a metaphor, rather than a historical text, we can all draw deeper meaning from its content. More of society can relate to the Bible, such as those who are scientific thinkers. For instance, the creation story now draws a different meaning. The seven days are symbolic of the long process, rather than a mere week. The presence of only Adam and Eve is symbolic of the idea that we humans are all related to each other by our feelings, our desires for happiness, and more. Therefore, in such a text-based Area of Knowledge that is usually heavily based on being true, sometimes, true explanations are not the best for explaining the unknowns of life. Through metaphors, explanations are no longer historically true, but they integrate into society more smoothly and allow more people to apply the Bible to their own lives. \nHowever, others may argue that the Catholic Bible and many other religious texts are legitimate historical records. However, to what extent is this true? As a student, I find it very difficult to ignore the scientific evidence we have today and believe the events of the Bible occurred. For instance, I learned that the story of Noah’s Ark, which states that all humans were killed in a flood, except for Noah and the animals he saved; however, through reasoning, many would find this story highly illogical and absurd. Most of the stories of the Bible are simply too extraordinary to occur, and those who believe in the Bible as history may force their views onto others. In a rapidly changing world, such controversial biblical stories often cause uproar, causing debate about abortions, stem cell treatments and much more, resulting in the loss of these scientific advancements for all of society, impacting individuals who do not align themselves with religion, but are forced to live with rules governed by religious bodies. Furthermore, whether religious texts are true life events will always remain unknown to us. Therefore, these reasons compel me to believe that good explanations do not have to be true. For the Area of Knowledge Religious Knowledge Systems, everyone chooses to understand a religious text differently. When I was attending Catholic school, I found it extremely difficult to relate to these stories, because many would contradict my moral compass or sound completely absurd. In my opinion, applying the parables as metaphors for life, rather than true events, allows for more individuals to relate to the Bible and aid us in life, rather than contradict life.\nSince doing the ToK program, I began to wonder about the point of being taught old, invalid scientific theories. However, I am glad I learned these theories, because without learning them, there would be holes in my knowledge. Additionally, these models provide insight into the ever constant human endeavor for progress that I have come to appreciate and hopefully pursue in my own life. Furthermore, in the case of Religious Knowledge Systems, I was taught to believe that Biblical events were true and I rebelled against the Bible because the events would contradict my scientific beliefs. However, as I got older, I began to view the Bible differently, and by using the Bible as an allegorical text, rather than a history textbook, I was able to extract meanings and messages that provide meaning and understanding in my life. \nIn conclusion, through the Areas of Knowledge of Natural Sciences and Religious Knowledge systems, I firmly believe that good explanations do not have to be true. When evaluating the “goodness” of an explanation it's trueness should only be one factor that determines its value. By teaching complex scientific theories to the general population, most will react with frustration, rather than enthusiasm; thus, I am grateful that teachers have taught me theories that are not completely true, because my enthusiasm is nurtured, I am motivated to continually gain knowledge. Furthermore, using the Bible as a metaphor invites everyone to interpret messages to their own personal understanding, allowing for the inclusion of all. Therefore, how explanations can change the lives of society should dictate its “goodness”. \n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/do-good-explanations-have-to-be-true/","title":"⚗️ Do good explanations have to be true?"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/end-2021/":{"body":"Turning 20\nI feel like it's actually more common for a university student in Vancouver to not have a driver's licence then to have one. My parents told me the longer I wait to get my driver's licence, the harder it would be, since learning how to drive at an older age was harder. But I don't really see a reason to learn how to drive, because taking the bus is easier in Vancouver than Calgary and I don't really have access to a car. \nBut I guess now I'm in my early 20s? It still feels like I'm 16; kinda excited for the world but also kinda scared. These days it's leaning more towards feeling more scared than excited. \nI think I might have taken on too much; thinking about my education\nI was excited to get back to in person. I was even more excited when I got a TA offer for CPSC 110. I was even even more excited to take my first biochemistry class and CPSC 213. But I took on too much this term. I was also involved with 3 side projects, one being part of the nwPlus team, another being part of the StarHacks team, and lastly one side project that I had to drop out of. I was tired everyday, exhausted and could barely focus. My sleep varied anywhere from 5 hours to 9; and I really felt the effects of a inconsistent sleep schedule. I also felt like I didn't have enough time to study, but let's see if that's true. \nFor reference, per credit, you should dedicate 2-3 hours of study time per week. Most of my courses were 3 credit, so I should be spending 9 hours per week. I had one 4 credit course, CPSC 213, and that course would expect around 12 hours per week of study. I'm choosing the upper bounds because I struggle with computer science and math courses.\nLooking back on time spent per subject, it seems to me like I spent:\n\nCPSC 213: 135 hrs total, 10.38 hrs/week\nMATH 200: 129 hrs total, 9.92 hrs/week\nCPSC 320: 110 hrs total, 8.46 hrs/week\nBIOC 202: 91 hrs total, 7 hrs/week\nMICB 306: 68 hrs total, 5.23 hrs/week\n\n\nAll data was calculated from September 7th to December 7th (13 weeks). I'm actually surprised that I did spend enough time on my CPSC and MATH courses, but I felt like I was always behind in them. On the contrary, I wasn't spending nearly as much time in my BIOC and MICB course, but I always felt like I knew what was happening and I never fell behind too badly in those courses. I guess this means I'm not studying very efficiently in my CPSC and MATH courses. That's something I'm going to have to think about; how I can efficiently and effectively study in CPSC and MATH.\nThinking about my future\nWorking at Microsoft changed what I wanted to do after I graduated. I didn't have the best time, (maybe I'll write about it), and had some breakdowns that are related to how I felt about my experience at Microsoft. To keep it short and simple, I didn't really like the corporate world. Someone who helped me get through the time at Microsoft, and someone I look up to, led to me reading this article and watching this video. Again, to put it short and sweet, there was someone on our team that required me to give alot, and I broke down in the process. Even better (well actually worse), I interviewed to return to a health and tech focussed team at Microsoft, but was rejected because my project was lacking technically; since my project wasn't technically challenging enough, the health team decided that I was lacking in technical skills, in comparison to other candidates. To say I was crushed at the time would be an understatement. Not only was I slightly embarrassed, but this meant if I took my return offer, I would have to work within the Teams organization (ew). I was left pretty soured by this experience. \nAnother aspect of just corporate in general (and maybe Garage Program specific) was that I just felt like I was working on useless sh*t that would never see the day of light. It's important for me to see my work make an impact, and I just felt like this project was something to keep the interns busy. Even worse, the entire project was done in JavaScript and C#, basically the last two programming languages I'd choose to work with.\nWhat was pretty awesome was that I bonded and become close friends with two students from U of T, and we talk to this day about anything that comes to our mind. We also played a bunch of Overcooked during our internship 😳.\nI think going to grad school for biochemistry, computer science or biomedical engineering would be really cool, but my grades aren't the best, so I'm not sure if that is the path I can take.\nOn my appearance\nThis year I kinda did something wild (for me). I dyed the inside parts of my hair blue and got my lobes double pierced. I've been thinking about making these changes for at least a year, and telling my boyfriend about it basically everyday. And when I got it done, I really liked how it changed my look. Maybe I'll dye my hair again?? But I had to sit for around 5 hours, and that was quite painful, so maybe I'll dye my hair once a year. \n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/end-2021/","title":"🐈 so 2021 is done"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/first-dev-exp/":{"body":"Who would of thought that my first job would take place in my bedroom?

Free food, tech companies and swag? What else could you ask for? Well, under all the free food and company shirts lies copy pasted Stack Overflow code, dry eyes, and more. Attending hackathons now seems like a chore I need to check off as a computer science student. And frankly, I feel guilty for feeling this way. But after reading this blurb from Design Justice, this blog post from Jacky, and various other posts such as this, this and this I've realised that everything I feel towards hackathons is valid. For some context, I started going to hackathons in 2019 in my first year of university, so my hackathon experience may not match yours. These are purely my own experiences and may not reflect the majority of hackathon experiences.\nMy stomach and head hurt; all the health problems!\nWhen I attend a hackathon, I always plan for the next day to be a recovery day. From sore eyes, to a constipated stomach, a thobbing headache, and back pain, that's the type of day I can expect right after a hackathon. The impact hackathons have on my health is a major reason I stopped attending. \nSomething like the hackathon diet always messes up my digestion for anywhere from a day to a week. I'm easily constipated from a lack of vegetables and high intake of junk food. For instance, a hackathon diet made of a glass of orange juice and bagel, a few slices of pizza, and chinese takeout is low in protein, vitamins and minerals and high in fat, sodium and sugar. And this is without the energy drinks and snacks one may eat throughout a hackathon. For me, a day eating at a hackathon causes painful bloating and constipation the next day. \nHackathons rarely offer healthy alternatives, aside from some fruit at breakfast, and it makes eating difficult for me. Yes, I could bring my own food but that involves packing 3 meals, carrying those meals around and making sure those meals don't go bad. And having healthy options is always a positive, as it's proven eating unhealthy food makes you think and respond slowly - everyone wants maximum brain power at a hackathon right?\nAdditionally, the lack of sleep nearly every participant will experience can causes anything from slower cognitive response to a thobbing headache. Then there's the backpain from sitting all day and the dry eyes from staring at a screen. And leg pains from sitting cross-legged if you're me. A hackathon forces your body in awkward positions for hours. \nUnfortunately, this is what you can expect at 99% of hackathons. \nA dumpster fire of JavaScript, corporate APIs, AI and stuff I don't understand from Stack Overflow\nI have a burning hate for JavaScript (I'm sorry). JavaScript with a couple of APIs from Google (hopefully an blockchain deep learning API) and Stack Overflow posts gives you the typical hackathon project. This type of project is \"built fast\" and breaks even faster. I also believe that hackathons perpetuate the cycle of using JavaScript for everything and anything (which I do not agree with). One might argue JavaScript allows for an idea to quickly turn into a product, which is true and very attractive at a hackathon. But if you want that JavaScript product to last, you're going to need a team and alot of time just to maintain it. Now using another programming language like Reason might take longer to create a product, but the time needed to maintain and fix bugs in a project in Reason is almost none. \n\nMessenger used to receive bugs reports on a daily basis; since the introduction of Reason, there have been a total of 10 bugs (that's during the whole year, not per week)! \n\nand \n\nRefactoring speed went from days to hours to dozens of minutes. \n\nIn a world of exploding technological innovation, thinking about sustainability and maintainability is a must when building a product. And I believe using JavaScript is not the awnser to creating sustainable or maintainable technology. This is my very personal opinion. Will I still work on projects with JavaScript, like at work? Unfortunately yes. But in my own time I will be staying away from JavaScript as much as I can. \nAdditionally, I don't learn much by hastily copying a piece of code from Stack Overflow or using an API endpoint that does everything for me. And to be really frank, there is no way I will produce any remotely helpful or useful in 24 hours. Much less so a functional product. Can some people do it? Yes, but the vast majority of hackers are beginners. Which leads to my next point below...\nWhat are we trying to solve here?\nIt's funny how a microbiology class fundamentally changed the way I went about thinking about solving problems. In MICB 202, I learned about cholera, an acute diarrhoeal infection caused by ingesting water or food contaminated with the bacterium Vibrio cholerae. How would one go about reducing the cases of cholera? Well, by cleaning up the water. But how? Using chemicals? Using energy to kill off bacteria? While these are good great solutions, there's one thing we are forgetting about. The context of the problem. [https://www.pnas.org/content/100/3/1051] \nHackathons are so isolated from the problem that alot of context is ignored, and this results in most solutions being useless. \nNot beginner friendly if you don't already know how to do everything\nWhile hackathons are great places to be introduced to so many new concepts, are they the best place to really learn and understand these new concepts? Hackathons celebrate this culture of \"move fast and break things\", and this implies that one must learn fast too. I don't know about you, but I don't learn fast, and especially not if I've been eating nothing but chocolate candy bars for the past 5 hours. Coupled with learning about something I'm not really interested in, such as a company tool for a prize category, hackathons have made me lose the joy of learning about technology. It's also demotivating to see a team of highly skilled individuals who come in every move planned out; not everyone has the time to plan for a hackathon weekend. And I am definitelys not as skilled as someone who's been programming since high school. Always feeling \"behind\" others is partially why I felt like dropping out of computer science, which propelled my decision to pursue a minor in biochemistry. \nI'm a slow learner, and I'm slowly (haha) coming to terms with that. I'm also rediscovering the privledge of learning about things you're interested in for no goal but to learn about these things; I'm not trying to become the next Elon Musk. For instance, I've recently become interested in developer tooling like Semantic and strongly typed programming languages like Haskell and ReScript. I'm learning them when I feel like it and as slow as I want to. I'm also a chemistry nerd at heart, so I've added a biochemistry minor to my degree for no purpose but to nerd out in biochemistry classes. \nSo what am I doing now?\nObviously, I'm not attending hackathons to build projects. But I'm still checking out a few hackathons for workshops and panels. And I think that's what I'll stick to for the time being. I would love for hackathons to become places where you are only expected to learn and to tinker, and there's no pressure to become the next startup. \n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/hackathons/","title":"❌ No more hackathons for me"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/ib/":{"body":"Are you taking IB courses?

The program develops \"internationally minded people, who recognizing their common humanity and shared guardianship of the planet, help to create a better and more peaceful world\" (IB mission).\n\n\nThe programme encourages participation in creative and service-oriented actions, as well as personal and academic reflection, addresses intellectual, social, emotional and physical well-being and covers the curriculum required by Alberta Education and the IB programme.\n\nIn the IB programme, there are two levels of courses you can take: standard level (SL) and higher level (HL). Most SL courses cover your standard curriculum while HL courses cover some first-year university content. You must take 3 HL courses and up to 4 and then the remaining courses being SL courses. That is of course for full IB students - you take 6 courses total. Of those 6 courses, you must take one language, two sciences, literature, history, and math (at my high school). Full IB students must also take a Theory of Knowledge Course and submit an Extended Essay.\nThere are also partial IB students who just take a few courses (at least one humanity and one science/math at my high school). They do not need to take a Theory of Knowledge Course or submit an Extended Essay. \nThis guide will be most aligned with students interested in computer science! But you can general points in the TLDR. \nI took: \n\nChemistry HL, English Literature HL, History HL\nPhysics SL, Mandarin SL, Mathematics SL\n\nI’ll go into deeper detail about each course and the impact it has had on my two years at UBC.\nCourses I'm glad I took: \n\nChemistry HL\nEnglish Literature HL\nHistory HL\nTheory of Knowledge\nPhysics SL → I don't regret taking Physics SL, but I would have liked to take Physics HL (however I would take Mathematics HL over Physics HL, and that's why Physics SL is here).\n\nCourses I regret taking (and what I would replace them with):\n\nMandarin Ab Initio → literally any other language\nMathematics SL → Mathematics HL\n\nChemistry HL\nBy taking Chemistry HL, you can fulfill the lab and science requirements for the BSc. Additionally, if you are planning to major in life sciences, taking Chemistry HL will help you prepare for the university-level chemistry content, which is very different from what you learn in high school. With my credit from Chemistry HL, I skipped CHEM 121 and I went straight into CHEM 123, which was a breeze for me.\nEnglish Literature HL\nFor many people, English can be a demanding course, which can have the negative effect of also lowering your GPA. If you take English Literature HL you can skip 6 credits of the first year ENGL courses - that's your comminations requirement. For this meant I did not do any ENGL courses in university!\nHistory HL\nAs a BSc. student you need 12 art credits in addition to communications courses. Since I took History HL, I got 6 credits worth of HIST courses - that's already half of your required arts credits! \nPhysics SL\nI got 3 credits for PHYS 100, but I didn't need credits for PHYS 100. I would have preferred not to get credit for PHYS 100, but UBC takes all your transfer credit for IB or none. The 3 credits added towards my total credits taken which you can read about here. If you took Physics HL, then you would be able to replace PHYS 100 (3) and PHYS 1st-year level (3), with exemption from PHYS 101, which would also complete your lab requirements and allow you to register for higher-level physics courses. \nMandarin Ab Initio\nThis is more of a personal reason for me. I'm pretty white-washed, so I speak Mandarin at the level of a preschooler. But the thing is, teaching Mandarin at the high school level is just really hard for me. I wish I choose a language that used the alphabet instead, as I just couldn't grasp Mandarin fast enough. I still speak Mandarin at the level of a preschooler. You don't get any credit for taking an ab initio language.\nMathematics SL\nThis is probably the course I almost wish I took at the HL level. Math HL teaches you how to write proofs, which is something the standard high school curriculum is missing. Knowing how to write proofs gives you a leg up as a math or computer science student. Additionally, you can skip MATH 100 and MATH 101, and go straight into MATH 200 and MATH 221 (for computer science students)! But be warned that MATH HL is no easy feat. If you decide to take MATH HL you will need to put in the work. You don't get any credit for taking Mathematics SL. \nTheory of Knowledge\nFor full IB students, we are required to write a TOK Essay. You can read about that here: http://www.howtoib.com/writing-tok-essays/. I think TOK essays are super interesting, and if you get above a B on your essay, you can get transfer credit for 6 credits worth of PHIL courses. And with those 6 credits, I was already done my arts requirements as a BSc. student. \n\nOverall\nDue to my choices, I took only 7 courses in my first year. But even with such a light load, I was already done my arts requirements, lab requirement, and communications requirements. The downside to taking IB courses is that you can go over your credit limit(48, I think I had 47) due to transfer credits, which means you could not be able to be promoted to the second year. You can read more about that here: https://science.ubc.ca/students/requirements/promotion. \nHowever, make sure to check your university's policy on IB credits. UBC allows you to use all of your IB courses for transfer credit, whereas U of Waterloo has limits. But make sure you realize the hard work you will have to put in if you decide to choose HL courses. You are learning standard high school and first-year university content at the same time that other students are learning just the standard high school content. IB courses, whether they are SL or HL, also require IA (internal assessments) which are research-like papers.\nAm I glad I took IB? Of course! If I were given the chance to do high school again I would choose to do IB.\nTLDR\nCheck here for all the credits you can get for your IB courses: https://you.ubc.ca/applying-ubc/applied/first-year-credit/\nYou're a student who does not to want to take any arts electives:\n\nTake History HL, English Literature HL, any HL language course.\nIf you are a full IB student, score well on your Theory of Knowledge essay (at least a B) and you can get 6 philosophy credits (that's two courses).\nIf you're a BSc. you will have fulfilled all your arts requirements (including communications)\n\nYou're a student who does not to want to take any science electives:\n\nTaky any HL science in high school and you will get at least 3/4 credits if you score well on your IB exams!\n\nYou're a student is okay with arts electives, but you don't want English to drag down your GPA:\n\nTake English Literature HL or English Language and Literature HL.

After some hardware issues, I reverted back to Windows. Well, this summer of 2021, I'm back to try to use Linux again. \nIt's been a month since I tried out Pop!_OS and here are my thoughts! I'll keep adding to this post as I continue to use Pop!_OS. For anyone else reading this, I have a HP Spectre 360x.\nSome differences from last summer:\n\n\nI'll be dual booting. There's some things on Windows, like better touchscreen support, that I use time to time. Additionally, if anything ever happens on my Linux setup, I can go back to my Windows setup. I recently completely removed Windows and now am only running Pop!_OS.\n\n\nI'll be trying out Pop!_OS this time vs. Ubuntu Budgie.\n\n\nStuff I like\n\nKeyboard shortcuts! Such a time saver. They are built into Pop!_OS so you don't need to do anything to set up them!\nSearching up applications: when I search for apps on Windows, I press the Windows key and then start typing. But since it has to switch from the menu to the search, there's always lag and it skips a few of the first characters. For instance, \"word\" becomes \"ord\". On Pop!_OS, search is SO fast.\nMy wifi doesn't break anymore? Before on Windows I was disconnected from my wifi everyday for a few minutes. Now it just doesn't happen when I use Linux. Weird...\nThe terminal: before I was using WSL2 which works, but there's downsides to it (file transfer is hella slow). Now with a Linux shell everything is so fast and it just works. \napt! downloading programs is super easy with apt and there's also a pop shop!\nStuff just runs faster? In WSL2, the commands like code . or zola serve took at least 5-10 seconds to run. In Pop!_OS it's almost instant.\nNOTIFICATIONS DON'T COME FROM THE BOTTOM RIGHT. If Windows moved their notifications to anywhere but the bottom right, I'd consider using Windows again. \nTiling and Stacking is so fast and so convenient. I'm not sure how I was able to use Windows now that I use these features...\n\n\n\nSo fast 😍 and no mouse involved. And yes, I am using the macOS background.\nStuff I miss\n\nI miss the touchscreen support for drawing. It's not really usable on Linux because I kinda lost all the hardware/drivers support. But I knew this could be an issue.\nNotion: there's no official Notion desktop application for Linux. But no worries, I used this. Unfortunately, is seems like there is no longer support for it so I'll have to see how it goes...\nMoniter support: On Windows, it matches the resolution or something so that applications don't look too small or too large on screens of different sizes (something called fractional scaling). Sadly, this is very slow on Pop!_OS. This means I can only have applications in one resolution size, so stuff on my moniter might look a bit big and stuff on my laptop screen might look a bit small. But after a few weeks I've gotten used to this.\n\nProblems\n\nThe bluetooth is kinda buggy, but this reddit post helped kinda fix it? \nGestures didn't work out of the box but after installing Touchegg they seem to work now.\nI don't like 21.04 as much (and it was crashing my laptop). I reverted the update (reinstalled the OS from scratch) and I'm back on 20.10.\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/linux-again/","title":"👩🏻‍💻 I am trying Linux again"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/racket/":{"body":"awesome book on creating languages in racket\nThese are my notes on creating programming languages with Racket. \nmaking funstacker, a functional version of stacker\nYou can find the full tutorial here.\n(define (read-syntax path port)\n  (define src-lines (port-&gt;lines port))\n  (define src-datums (format-datums '~a src-lines))\n  (define module-datum `(module funstacker-mod \"funstacker.rkt\"\n                          (handle-args ,@src-datums)))\n  (datum-&gt;syntax #f module-datum))\n(provide read-syntax)\n\n\nformat-datums takes the list of lines and changes it into data. \nfor funstacker, we just want to return the input as 1 2 + 3 * and change it into (handle 1 2 + 3 *).\nthat is what (handle-args ,@src-datums) is doing.\nnow we need to make the handle-args function.\n\nfor/fold\n(for/fold ([sum 0])\n          ([int (list 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10)])\n          (+ sum int))\n\nfor/fold iterates over a list of values and each pass of the loop also returns an accumulator. The value of the accumulator is replaced with a new value. The loop ends when the iterator runs out of values. The return value is the final value of the accumulator.\nFor the example above, the accumulator is sum and iterator is int. \nfor/fold has two mandatory parts, and two optional parts.\n\nat least one accumulator needs to be defined and every accumulator needs to have an inital value.\nat least one iterator needs to be defined.\n(optional) guard expression, which limits the iteration with a test condition.\n(optional) sequence constructor in-list. any sequence can be used directly as source of iterator values, including any list. \n\nmaking bf, the next step!\ntutorial here\nintro\nThe essential parts of a language are:\n\nreader\nexpander\n\nBut now we want to add grammer, basically allow us to specify the structure of a language. We need two new pieces:\n\nparser\ntokenizer\n\nTo use bf in racket: #lang bf-demo\nhow bf works\n\nwhen starting up: create array of bytes in memory (each byte initialized to 0) and pointer into that array (initialized to the 0 position). \nthe current byte is the byte in the array at the location indicated by the pointer. \nthere are 6 operations:\n\n&gt; increase pointer position by one\n&lt; decrease pointer position by one\n\n\nincrease the value of the current byte by one\n\n\n\n\ndecrease the value of the current byte by one\n\n\n. write current byte to stdout\n, read a byte from stdin and store it in the current byte (overwriting the existing value)\n\n\n\nThere is also a looping construct [...] that will repeat code within the brackets until the current byte is zero.\nRecall the two functions each language needs: \n\nreader: converts source file from string of characters into parenthesized S-expressions. read-syntax\nexpander: determines how the S-expressions correspond to Racket code. Starts with macro called #%module-begin\n\nClean, well-structured S-expressions makes writing an expander much easier.\nThe way we can convert any well-specified programming language into S-expressions is by using a grammar.\ngrammars and parsers\nparsing and parse trees\nparsing: converting source code from a format for humans into one optimized for a computer.\n\nthe data structure that emerges from the parser is a parser tree.\n\nIn Racket, a parse tree can be notated as an S-expression. A parse tree describes structure of code, but doesn't tell us how the code will actually run.\nif y &gt; 0:\n  x / y\nelse:\n  print(\"nope\")\n\n'(if (&gt; y 0)\n     :\n     (/ x y)\n     else:\n     (print \"nope\"))\n\n(if (&gt; y 0)\n  (/ x y)\n  (print \"nope\"))\n\nRacket looks similar to the parse tree!\nparsing power tool: a grammar\nIt makes more sense to use a parser generator to make a parser from a specification of the structure of the language (a grammar).\n\na grammar: way of notating the structure of every possible program written in that language.\ngrammar based parser is like regular expression, but it produces parse trees.\n\nwhy we should write a grammar vs. make a parser by hand.\n\nwe can use grammars that already exist, like Python's grammar, to make a Python-like language.\na grammar is a reality check; if we can write a grammar, chances are good that the language will work out. If we can't, it's a warning our language will have wrinkles (Markdown)\neasier to amend a grammar then hand-crafted parser. \n\nwhy we can't parse with regular expressions \n\nregular expressions treat strings as flat, sequential data\n\ngrammar notation\n\nconsists of production rules, written one per line. On the left of each rule is the name of the structural element. A colon goes in the middle of the rule. This notation style is known as EBNF. On the right of each rule, we have a pattern for that element.\nthe right side can include: literal strings, classes of strings, names of other production rules. Multiple possibilities are separated by |\n\napplying a grammar\n\nparser takes string of source code\nstarting with first production rule, parser tries to match source code to pattern on the right.\nif the pattern contains names of other rules of grammar, parser recursively tries to match those rules, again using patterns on the right.\n\nThis process continues until one of two things:\n\nthe parser decomposes source code into something that can't be further decomposed -&gt; terminals. A parse tree is returned (the leaves of a parse tree are always terminals)\nthe parser can't find any way to decompose source code into terminals; parse fails.\nIt's trial and error (parser could try lots of unsuccessful paths)\n\nambiguous grammars\n\nyou could write a grammar that can produce more than one valid parse tree for the same string\nbut you should avoid this\n\ngroups and multiples in patterns\na grammar for stacker\nstacker-program : \"\\n\"* instruction (\"\\n\"+ instruction)*\ninstruction     : integer | func\ninteger         : [\"-\"] digit+\ndigit           : \"0\" | \"1\" | \"2\" | \"3\" | \"4\"\n                | \"5\" | \"6\" | \"7\" | \"8\" | \"9\"\nfunc            : \"+\" | \"*\"\n\n\nparenthesizes create subsequences. \n* means zero or more\n+ means match one or more of the preceding item\n[] means zero or 1 of the enclosed item\n\n4\n8\n+\n3\n*\n\n'(stacker-program\n  (instruction (integer (digit \"4\")))\n  \"\\n\"\n  (instruction (integer (digit \"8\")))\n  \"\\n\"\n  (instruction (func \"+\"))\n  \"\\n\"\n  (instruction (integer (digit \"3\")))\n  \"\\n\"\n  (instruction (func \"*\")))\n\nnotes about how the parse tree lines up with the grammar:\n\neach node in parse tree corresponds to production rule, starting with name of rule followed by elements that matched the pattern for that rule\nrules that rely on other rules leads to nesting.\nevery character that appeared in original source string appears in parse tree.\n\nthe parser\n\nbf is just a list of operations and loops\n\nso the first line means: either bf-op or bf-loop and zero or more of\n\n\nnow define bf-op and bf-loop\n\nbf-program: (bf-op | bf-loop)* \nbf-op: \"&gt;\" | \"&lt;\" | \"+\" | \"-\" | \".\" | \",\" \nbf-loop: \"[\" (bf-op | bf-loop)* \"]\"\n\nand that's the grammar for bf! There are other ways to define the grammar but this is the easiest because bf-program only appears ones and it is the least number of rules.\nconverting a grammar to a parser\n\nwe will use a parser-generating language called brag that takes a list of production rules and turns those into a working parser.\n\nthe tokenizer\n\nsource string is converted to tokens\ntokenizer sits between source string and parser\na tokenizer is optional: if we don't use a tokenizer, then every character that appears in the source code counts as a token.\n\nSome tasks that are easily handled by the tokenizer?\n\nmeaningless strings in source code can be removed\nstrings that represent a value can be labeled with a generic token type\nstrings that should be handled literally can just pass through\n\nDownside to a tokenizer\n\nsubstrings removed (like comments) are invisible to the parser.\ntokens are indivisible; once we fuse a substring into a token, it can't be decomposed further by the parser. big tokens can be convenient because they reduce complexity, but they also reduce flexibility.\n\ndesigning the bf tokenizer\nThe bf grammar omits one detail: that any characters besides the eight used should be ignored.\n\nthe bf tokenizer is simple: pass through eight characters intact and toss out everything else\n\nwriting a reader with a tokenizer\n\ninstead of manually reading in strings of code from port, pass port to make tokenizer, which returns function that reads characters from port and generates tokens\n\nmake-tokenizer creates and returns a function next-token that parser calls repeatedly to retrieve new tokens\n\n\nuse those tokens with parse, to make parse-tree\ncreate module-datum and put parse-tree inside\nfinally use datum-&gt;syntax to package code as syntax object\n\ntokenizing rules\n\nhelper function: lexer\n\neach branch of lexer represent a rule: right side of token-creating expression, left side is pattern\neach time next-token is called, bf-lexer will read as many characters from port as possible while still matching a rule pattern (greedy matching).\nright side of rule with convert matched characters into token, which is returned\n\n\n\n(require brag/support) ;; we need to so we can get lexer\n(define (make-tokenizer port)\n  (define (next-token)\n    (define bf-lexer\n      (lexer\n       [(char-set \"&gt;&lt;-.,+[]\") lexeme] ; matches to one of our eight characters; we pass to lexeme (that thing we just matched)\n       [any-char (next-token)])) ; think of else as else branch; we call next-token, basically skipping to the next available token\n    (bf-lexer port))  \n  next-token)\n\n\nat the end, an eof is emitted, the lexer emits an eof \n\nmaking the expander: an imperative expander\n\ngrammar tells us how many macros or functions we need\nwe need to handle three types of parse nodes: bf-program, bf-op, bf-loop\n\nWhy grammar is awesome\n\neach production rule in the grammar will have a corresponding macro/function in the expander.\nthe name of the production rule is the name of the macro/function\nthe pattern of the production rule describes possible input to its corresponding macro or function.\n\nChoosing function vs macro: use function where we can, a macro where we must\n\nsimple (return its args in a list or print them) -&gt; use function\nrearrange code in a way that a function can't -&gt; macro\n\n+[&gt;] will be parsed into:\n(bf-program (bf-op \"+\") (bf-loop \"[\" (bf-op \"&gt;\") \"]\"))\n\nour expander goes as follows:\n\ncall bf-program macro with two input arguments:\n\n(bf-op \"+\")\n(bf-loop \"[\" (bf-op \"&gt;\") \"]\")\n\n\ncall bf-op macro with one input:\n\n\"+\"\n\n\ncall bf-loop macro with three input arguments:\n\n\"[\"\n\"]\"\n(bf-op \"&gt;\")\n\n\ncall the bf-op macro with one input argument:\n\n\"&gt;\"\n\n\n\nfrom grammar to syntax pattern\n\nsyntax pattern is like a regular expression\n\nbf-program macro:\nbf-program: (bf-op | bf-loop)*\n(bf-program OP-OR-LOOP-ARG ...)\n\n\nbf-program denotes literal identifier in the code, and is name of macro. every element of a define-macro syntax pattern matches literally\nunless it's in all caps. \n\npattern variable: can catch everything\n\n\nthe ..., similar to * quantifier. used after a pattern variable, the ... gathers al arguments that follow. can also match 0 arguments.\n\nReturn value of a macro is a syntax template.\n\nwe return a void, which discards the arguments.\ndefine-macro-cases it's like a cond\n\na functional expander\nWe have two goals\n\navoid keeping state\navoid mutation\n\nTricky because bf by nature is imperative\n\nin funstacker we learned we can approximate behaviour of state variables by turning them into accumulators with for/fold\nwith functional programming idiom: model bf operations that take a current array and pointer as input and return new array and pointer values as output.\ninstead of storing state values outside the function, let the values travel through the functions\n\nrestarting the expander\n\nmodel new bf operations as functions that take two input arguments, array and pointer, and return a new array and pointer.\nwe want return value of a bf-func to become input arguments of the next-bf-func. \n\nbut bf-func only returns one value and next-bf-func needs two values.\nwe cure this mismatch by using apply\n\n\n\napply\n\ntakes a function and list of values as input, and calls the function while using those values as input arguments\nthese two expressions are equivalent\nkind of like takes the list apart.\n\n(apply func (list arg1 arg2 arg3 arg4))\n(func arg1 arg2 arg3 arg4)\n\n\nthe above example stipulates func is a run time function, not a macro; macros cannot be passed as an argument to any higher order function.\n\n(define (fold-funcs apl bf-funcs)\n  (for/fold ([current-apl apl])\n            ([bf-func (in-list bf-funcs)])\n    (apply bf-func current-apl)))\n\n\nfold-funcs: takes two input args, apl and a pointer; the return value of bf-func and list of bf-funcs\nwhen for/fold starts, it creates an accumulator called current-apl to hold current state of the bf program, and initializes it to the apl argument passed as input.\nthen it iterates over the list of bf-funcs\non each iteration it uses apply to pass current-apl as arguments to the next bf-func\nonce we run out of bf-funcs, the last value of current-apl becomes the return value of the for/fold loop, and therefore the fold-funcs function.\n\nnow we can write the macro for bf-program\n(define-macro (bf-program OP-OR-LOOP-ARG ...)\n  #'(begin\n      (define first-apl (list (make-vector 30000 0) 0))\n      (void (fold-funcs first-apl (list OP-OR-LOOP-ARG ...)))))\n(provide bf-program)\n\n\nwe want to return code for two expressions; syntax object can only represent one.\nany time we want to return multiple expressions: use begin\n\nunlike let, begin does not create a new scope for variables, any variables inside a begin are visible outside as well\n\n\nmacro should not return a value, so pass result to a void.\n\nnow we write the macro for bf-loop; there are two things to observe\n\nwhen bf-loop arrives at fold-funcs, it is expected to behave as bf-func. So the return value of bf-loop macro has to be a function that has two input args and 1 output arg.\nbf-loop is mini bf program that runs repeatedly until a certain condition is met.\n\n(define-macro (bf-loop \"[\" OP-OR-LOOP-ARG ... \"]\")\n  #'(lambda (arr ptr)\n      (for/fold ([current-apl (list arr ptr)])\n                ([i (in-naturals)]\n                 #:break (zero? (apply current-byte\n                                       current-apl)))\n        (fold-funcs current-apl (list OP-OR-LOOP-ARG ...)))))\n(provide bf-loop)\n\nthe last macro is bf-op, but instead of returning a self-contained function, just return only the name of corresponding function -&gt; so fold-funcs can apply a list of arguments to it.\nmaking it faster\n\nthis functional version is much slower because of the set-current-byte func\n\nwe make a new array every time, which is 30k bytes, and the garbage collector has to run more often to free up memory.\nto make it faster we can just use the input array\n\n\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/racket/","title":"λ Racket Shenanigans"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/rust/":{"body":"ch 1: getting started\nCargo.toml: manifest file for Rust. \n\nmetadata and dependencies\nsrc/main.rs where you write code.\n\ncargo new: generates a hello world program\ncargo run: run the program\nadding dependencies\nyou find libraries on crates.io, and packages are referred to as crates\ncargo-build to install the dependency.\n\nrunning this creates Cargo.lock, which is a log of the exact versions of dependencies we are using locally.\n\nhello world\n\nindent with four spaces, not tab\nprintln! is a macro;

we can change the type of the value and reuse the same name.\n\n3.2: data types\nscalar types\n\nsingle value: integers, floating-point numbers, Booleans, characters\n\ninteger types\n\nto prevent integer overflow\n\nwrap all modes with wrapping_* methods.\nreturn None is there is overflow with checked_* methods.\nreturn value and boolean indicating whether there was overflow with overflowing_* methods.\nsaturate at the value's min or max values with saturating_* methods.\n\n\n\nfloating-point types\nboolean type\n\none byte\n\ncharacter type\n\n4 bytes in size\n\ncompound types\ntuple type\n\nfixed length\nonce declared, cannot grow or shrink in size\n\nlet tup = (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);\nlet (x, y, z) = tup;\nlet one = x.2;\n\n\nto get individual values, we use pattern matching or period and index.\ntuple without any value, () is special type that has one vane, also written (). the type is called unit type and the value is called unit value.\n\nexpressions implicitly return unit value if they don't return any other value\n\n\n\narrays\n\nfixed length\nallocated on stack \n\nlet a: [i32;

no need to free anything when s1 goes out of scope.\n\n    let s1 = String::from(\"hello\");\n    let s2 = s1;\n\n    println!(\"{}, world!\", s1);\n\n\nmove: shallow copy and invalidates the first variable.\nRust never automatically creates deep copies; any automatic copies are assumed to be inexpensive.\n\nclone\n\ndeeply copy the heap data, not just stack data\nexpensive\n\ncopy\n\ntypes that have known size at compile time are stored entirely on the stack, so copies of actual type are quick to make.\nthere's no reason we would want to prevent x from being valid after creating y.\n\n    let x = 5;\n    let y = x;\n\n    println!(\"x = {}, y = {}\", x, y);\n\n\nno difference between deep and shallow copy here.\nRust has special annotation called Copy trait that is placed on types like integers.\nRust won't let us annotate a type with Copy trait if the type or any parts of it has implemented Drop trait.\n\nownership and functions\n\npassing a String, s, to a function means that s is no longer valid, the function owns s.\nreturning values can also transfer ownership.\nownership of a variable follows the same pattern: assigning a value to another variable moves it. \nwhen a variable that includes data on the heap goes out of scope, the value will be cleaned up by drop unless the data has been moved to be owned by another variable.\ntaking ownership and then returning ownership with every function is a bit tedious.\n\nwhat if we want to let a function use a value but not take ownership?\n\n\nanything we pass in also needs to be passed back if we want to use it again.\n\nfn main() {\n    let s1 = String::from(\"hello\");\n\n    let (s2, len) = calculate_length(s1);\n\n    println!(\"The length of '{}' is {}.\", s2, len);\n}\n\nfn calculate_length(s: String) -&gt; (String, usize) {\n    let length = s.len(); // len() returns the length of a String\n\n    (s, length)\n}\n\n\nwe can return multiple values in a tuple, and we need to return the string so we can use it again later.\nwe solve that issue by using references\n\n4.2 references and borrowing\n\nadd &amp; to denote references, allow you to refer to some value without taking ownership of it.\n\ncalled borrowing: we cannot modify a borrowed value; references are also immutable.\n\n\n\nmutable references\n\nchange the variable to be mut: let mut s = String::from(\"hello\")\ncreate a mutable reference with &amp;mut s and call the change function: change(&amp;mut s)\nupdate the function signature to accept mutable reference, some_string: &amp;mut String\n\n\nbut you can only have one mutable reference to a particular piece of data at a time.\nallows for mutation in a controlled fashion.\nthis prevents data races at compile time\n\na data race is similar to a race condition and occurs when:\n\ntwo or more pointers access the same data at the same time\nat least one of the pointers is being used to write to the data\nthere's no mechanism being used to synchronize access to the data\n\nRust won't even compile code with data races!\n\nwe can use curly braces to create a new scope.\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/rust/","title":"🦀 Rust notes"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/to-read/":{"body":"\nWhy FP Matters\nparaffin.hs\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/to-read/","title":"📖 To Read"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/to-watch/":{"body":"\nSquid Games\nLord of the Rings\nArcane\nThe Office\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/to-watch/","title":"👀 To Watch"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/wsl/":{"body":"I have a really bad habit of not remembering the steps I take to configure stuff.

The content is really interesting for sure, but the way this course was delivered during the pandemic made it hard for me to learn the content.\nSome people think prerecorded lectures are the holy grail. Unfortunately, prerecorded lectures take forever for me to watch. A one-hour recorded lecture always turns into a three-hour lecture. Additionally, we were given 20-page readings per week and we had 6ish quizzes making up our entire mark (which I failed at least one). The quiz and final questions were ambiguous and very unforgiving. This course was essentially converted into distance learning, which I've had a horrible experience with in the past.\nWould I recommend? No :( Not online at least.\nWhy I regret taking this course: There is no engagement with the professor and lots and lots of memorization of content. \n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/school/micb201/","title":"MICB 201"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/school/micb202/":{"body":"One of the most interesting courses I've taken at UBC. The instructors were so forgiving during the pandemic and they worked hard to create unique and fun assignments. We learned about the immune system, viruses, and bacterial diseases, which is pretty fitting for right now. The instructors were also knowledgeable about their topics at hand and I highly recommend this course to anyone interested in their immune system and viruses. Exam questions were very fair and we even had an assignment in which we were given a mystery virus and tasked to find which known virus it was most similar with.\nWould I recommend? Yes!\nWhat I love about the course: While this course is also a lot of memorization of content the instructors were very understanding of student's circumstances and worked hard on creating super engaging and interesting assignments.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/school/micb202/","title":"MICB 202"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/school/micb306/":{"body":"This is one of the most interesting and one of the best courses I've taken at UBC. In science, it's common that what is taught in school is a few years behind current research. But in this course, we have learned alot of new and present research, such that I think I can understand a virology paper decently well for an undergrad student. \nTaking Cell Biology, BIOL 200 and Introductory Medicinal Biochemistry BIOC 202 will be extremely helpful and aid in your success in this course.\nThe course was taught by two professors. The first part of the course was building up our foundation for the second part of the course. This involved basically reviewing different viral lifecycles for InfA and DENV at a high level, as well as general viralogy concepts. \nThe second part was much more in depth and really interesting. We learned about 4 viruses, Influenza A, Dengue Virus, Zika Virus and SARS-CoV-2. We studied various parts of viral cycles in depth and learned about drugs that could target certain steps. The final assignment was to create a multi-drug regimen for SARS-CoV-2; that involved reading lots of papers, but I enjoyed it. \nI didn't expect this course to be easy when I registered for it. Alot of the success in this course not only comes from having a good understanding of cell biology and biochemistry, but also being good at memorizing everything. I didn't get to study and review for this course as much as I had liked to, so I know my mark isn't as good as it could be, but I'm okay with that.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/school/micb306/","title":"MICB 306"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/school/micb308/":{"body":"","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/school/micb308/","title":"MICB 308"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/school/stat251/":{"body":"There's not much to say about this course. It's a pretty standard statistics course that teaches you about all the different types of distributions, conditional probability, and more.
