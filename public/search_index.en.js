Since then, I’ve been thinking of what computer education should look like at the secondary and elementary levels. I was first introduced to computer science when I heard the phrase “Everyone should learn how to code”. The more I think about this tech marketing mantra that has been screamed at me from every coding boot camp, online MOOC, and even President Obama, the more and more I disagree with it. Instead, we should all learn about computers. And no, not how to use Microsoft Word, but what a computer actually is. \n\nDoes that mean Lucy doesn’t like coding?\nThis article isn’t saying that we should not teach coding at all. Coding (or programming) is a mechanism to make a concept in computer science tangible or realizable. I’ll use a metaphor using concepts in chemistry. In organic chemistry, you study many reaction mechanisms to understand why some reactions go forward to produce the desired drug, while other reactions are futile. But being able to predict which product a reaction mechanism will produce is different from actually extracting the end product in a lab. In the lab, you need skills like pipetting, visual cues, knowledge of proper reactant ratios, how to extract and preserve the end product (you can’t just leave it in the reactant solution!), and more. Without these lab skills, it doesn't matter how good you are at organic chemistry, because you can’t even make the damn molecule. \nSimilarly, in the classroom, you might learn about tree traversal algorithms, the concept of allocating and freeing your memory, and how to prove your algorithm is correct and will produce the desired output, much like coming up with a reaction mechanism that produces the drug you want. But coding this algorithm requires you to understand, given whatever programming language you use, how to get that programming language running in the first place, the syntax rules (semicolons or parens?), how to spot and fix memory leaks, how to spot dangling pointers and more. Watching a video on pipetting doesn’t make you an expert at pipetting, just like how watching someone correctly implement an algorithm in C or Python doesn’t make you an expert coder. \nBut coding and pipetting are simply skills for different jobs. If you want to work in a chemistry lab, you will need lab skills. Similarly, if you want to become a software engineer, you'll need to code. This doesn’t mean coding is something everyone needs to learn, just like everyone doesn’t need to learn how to pipette because not everyone is not going to be producing drugs or programming applications. \nMaybe you argue that coding will become a part of everyone's jobs, but I don’t think this will happen. More likely to occur is that computers will become a part of everyone's jobs, but people don't need to know or understand C to use a computer. This is because software engineers will hide the coding details away into nice and easy-to-use user interfaces. When you drag a file into a folder, there is code being executed to signal to your computer that this file is in a new folder. But you didn’t have to get down and dirty in the code. All you have to do is use your mouse to drag the file over. \nHow did \"Learn to code?\" come about?\nBut before I get into why everyone should learn about computers, I wanted to explore deeper into this “Learn to Code” movement. \nHow \"Learn to Code\" got me into computer science\nI have loved chemistry since I was 13, maybe you could have guessed from the chemistry metaphor. I never cared about getting a high-paying job until I was applying for universities and realized you couldn’t get paid much for having a Bachelor's degree in chemistry. The “Learn to Code” movement caught my eye and I started to believe that coding was the future.\nPhrases like: \"Everyone should learn how to code\", \"Code to become the next Bill Gates\", gave me the impression that coding was a necessary skill everyone needed to know to succeed in the future, or else they would fail. I even wrote about \"coding being inevitable\" for everyone in my statement when I applied to UWaterloo (looking back, that was super cringe).\nI tossed my dream of pursuing chemistry away and decided to get a degree in computer science. \nWhy is learning to code such a hot topic?\nOkay, but so a lot more young people are learning how to code, and the movement is only growing in strength. I wondered why and came up with these points:\nAccessibility\nIn developed nations, over 80% of households have a personal computer. This makes coding very accessible, a vast improvement from the early ages of computers, where a computer filled a giant room and you had to line up and wait in order to run your code. This is unlike the other sciences. If you want to try out a chemistry experiment you read up on, good luck. Unless your high school or local university has a good supply of chemicals and proper equipment and permits you, there’s a very slim chance of trying out that chemical experiment. There are also more consequences if you screw up a chemical reaction, much less so if you forget a semicolon. Additionally, the learning curve for HTML is much lower than say physics or chemistry, which requires a good amount of study before you can run your own experiments. \nInstant gratification and Tech solutionism\nCoding delivers instant gratification, due to its accessibility and a concept called tech solutionism. It takes seconds to pull up an online REPL and execute code right in your browser. You don’t even need to understand the code to have something show up. This makes it seem like coding is easy, which it really isn’t. \nCoding can also feel like a shortcut to solving many problems since there’s a growing “belief that every problem has a solution based on technology”. Hackathons are such events that encourage this type of thinking, using challenge prompts like “Best hack that solves a climate problem”, leading hackers to feel lots of instant gratification in designing an application that they think is helpful, when it’s actually downright useless or even harmful. There is also an over-emphasis on the technology being used, with all the time and energy being poured into choosing which AI model to use or whether to use the blockchain or a regular database and shifting focus away from the actual problem. Tech takes many human problems, turning them into tech problems instead. An excellent talk on this idea is here. \nYou would never say other skills like wielding, cooking, or pipetting could solve all the world’s problems. Why is coding any different from other skills? \nCoding (and technology) has limitations, and many times coding can introduce problems you would never have with traditional or alternative methods. You can read about my thoughts on tech solutionism in hackathons here. For a much more in-depth understanding, read Design Justice.\nMarketing\nThere’s no marketing initiative as strong as “Learn to Code”. No one is marketing “Learn History” or “Learn Chemistry” because a bunch of people who know history or chemistry don't serve giant companies well. By giant companies, I mean tech companies. It’s cheap for a tech company to produce a MOOC and sell it to people desperate for a better-paying job. These people with only coding skills are then at the will of large companies to pick and choose who they want. And with only more and more people wanting a job in tech, companies can be less competitive with salaries.\nWhile “Learn to Code” isn’t as common now, there are other marketing campaigns and initiatives telling us to quickly learn about AI to get a job in AI or quickly learn about Web3 and get a job in Web3 because iTs tHe fuTUrE. You rarely ever see this in other areas such as chemistry, with organic chemistry being cool one year, and materials chemistry being hot another year. Fast Food Education discusses the rise of coding/design boot camps and their shallow and lacking curriculums, which flood the market with a bunch of people with the same skills.\nIs teaching everyone to code the right thing to do?\nAfter listening to talks from Simon Peyton Jones and reading from Critically Conscious Computing, we should most definitely not be all learning how to code. Instead, we should all be learning about how a computer works. To many, computers are “magical intelligent pieces of metal”. Before you learned about physics, chemistry, math, and biology you might have thought other events were magical, like how baking powder works, how that weird Möbius paper is a single-sided strip with one edge, and how sound travels. But through our education, we have all gained some understanding of how these magical events work; baking powder mixed with water produces carbon dioxide bubbles (making your muffins fluffy), the math behind the one-sided paper, and that sound travels in waves. Does learning to code accomplish one’s desire to understand how a computer works? \n\nNo, not always. Coding in high-level languages like Python, JavaScript, or scripting languages like HTML or CSS does not. This high-level coding is what is mostly taught by boot camps and current elementary and secondary computer science curriculums. Coding in Python simply lets us tell a computer what we want it to do (thanks to computer scientists who abstracted away a lot of details, it’s easy for anyone to write an easy program now). When you save a text file to your computer do you know how it’s saved on your computer? Coding in Python doesn’t tell you much if anything about how the computer saves your file. And another question to ponder is how a computer does anything! How does the computer save files and then find them later, what is an operating system and what does it manage and control, how does the computer manipulate incoming information, and much more? Learning to code from boot camps or online MOOCs tells you nothing about this. \nWhy learn about computers? [work in progress]\nI grew up right when social media was just starting to exist. I had to fight my dad to get an email and didn’t even do anything with the email once I got it. Computers weren’t part of my life like reading books was. I didn’t notice or care about computers. \nBut computers are now everywhere in society; cars, phones, traffic lights, dishwashers, to just name a few. \nComputers are complex and do many amazing things. It’s easy to view computers as magical. But they aren’t as magical as they seem. Did you know the first computer included wood parts and always broke? Computers were (and are) ever-evolving, which I think is amazing.\n\nI think there are three broad sections that should be covered for computers:\n\nWhat a computer is and isn't\nHow a computer works\nEthics and history of computers\n\nWhat a computer is and isn't\nI think computers are perhaps a combination of mathematics, physics, and chemistry. \nMathematics\nComputers do computing (obviously). \nWhat's computing?\nComputing is the act of performing mathematical or procedural tasks. You don’t need code to compute; all humans can compute! \nComputing is already taught as basic mathematical skills, like learning your time's tables and doing calculations by hand. In university, you then learn it again when you learn about binary and hexadecimal. \nComputing also involves the application of algorithms. How would you introduce an algorithm without code? It can be as simple as telling a group of students to sort themselves (based on height) using a sorting algorithm like bubble sort or merge sort. Then you can ask the students their observations on the different algorithms. \nA computer seems like it’s just doing magic, but it’s computing. The first computers were people (mostly women) during WWII, where they calculated the correct coordinates for projectiles. The abacus can also be seen as a computer, one of the first computing tools created by humans.\nI think that many emerging curriculums do introduce important concepts in computing, so I won’t discuss it much here. If you want to learn more about computing, I recommend watching videos from Simon Peyton Jones. \nComputers do millions of mathematical operations a second to display pictures on your screen and interpret signals from your keyboard. Humans have placed a lot of trust in computers being correct when doing math. And this trust has led to catastrophe. With the increasing use of computers to do calculations for us, it is imperative to teach students that computers are finite while mathematics is infinite. A computer is a handy machine, but that piece of metal cannot store all digits of pi. When dealing with irrational numbers, computers must always round. When you’re finding the area of a circle for math class, rounding errors are almost negligible, but for space operations, these errors can be much more catastrophic. \nPhysics [todo]\nPhysics because of the transfer of information and instructions through electrical signals. \nChemistry [todo]\nChemistry because of the special qualities of metals, rare earth metals, and silicon makes these elements the perfect medium for computing, as well as oxidation and reduction reactions that make batteries work.\nHow a computer works\nEven in my university classes, many students don’t recognize that someone, human, like us, designed the computer the way it is today. The use of QWERTY keywords isn't a phenomenon like gravity, it was a design choice. Someone is making these choices, and we should learn about these choices because there can be small and large consequences if we don’t. \nObviously I can't talk about everything about how a computer works. But there are 4 \"parts\" that when put together, allows a computer to work.\n\nOperating System\nFile System\nMemory\nProgramming Languages\n\nYou better trust your operating system! [todo]\nA misunderstanding/lack of understanding of a file system\nAs a Teaching Assistant, something I was surprised to see was how unfamiliar students were with their file system. When I was evaluating final projects in CPSC 210, I would try to run a program, only to see an error saying that a necessary file was missing. When I approached the student about the error, many would show me their program working perfectly fine on their computer.\nWhat happened was that the student was not checking if the project files were the same on their local machine and GitHub. Since I don’t have access to their local machine, I would retrieve the code from GitHub and run it on my machine. However, some files would still be on their computer, usually in the Downloads folder. Since the Downloads folder was not part of their git-tracked directories (essentially, git was not checking the Downloads folder to see if a new file was added), students would tell me “git didn’t tell me to commit this file”. Other similar issues involved the file existing on a student’s Desktop folder, which was also not tracked by git. Another related issue included the use of hard links like “/usr/lucy/myproject/code.java”, which only exists on Lucy’s computer, not Bob’s. All these mistakes involve a misunderstanding or lack of understanding of how a file system works. \nWhen I ask a student to find their project on their file system, many times, students respond with “what’s the file system” or tell me they have no idea where their project is. Honestly, the first few times I received questions like these I was surprised, but then I started to wonder why students were so unfamiliar with their file system. Even with personal computers becoming more and more common, there are a growing number of students who don’t understand or misunderstand how a file system works. I believe that if students were taught about how a computer manages files, which is similar but also different from how a librarian manages books, as part of their elementary or secondary education, I’d be receiving a lot fewer questions about file systems. \nHow memory works [in progress]\nAnother concept that I also recently learned was about how a computer writes data. When you delete a file or an important pdf, you would probably think it’s gone from your computer. However, in most cases, your deleted file is still there, until it gets overwritten.  All your computer does is keep track of memory that has information the user thinks is important, like a file that they saved. When a user deletes a file, the computer simply marks the area in memory, and information encoded by that memory, as information the user doesn't care about anymore. When you save a new file, the computer will overwrite that area in memory.\nThis means after you throw away your computer, you could still have important information on you computer that you meant to delete from the world! Someone could mount your file system and gain access to sensitive information. Again, this would have been something students should learn about. \n\nLearning about computers should be part of standard education because computers are everywhere and used by most people who have no idea how a computer works. Education should not purely serve to equip a group of people with skills for a career. Education is to help people understand the world around them. This is why we learn science in elementary school. While one can get through the world without understanding Newton’s Laws, acid and base theory, and cell biology, it can deepen your understanding of the world. When computers were only for government officials and university professors, it would have been pointless to teach the general public about computers. But now knowledge of computers should be taught to everyone. \nProgramming, or talking to your computer? [todo]\nEthics and History\nStudents must also be taught the ethics and history of computers and computing. A computer isn't like a cell. Computers were invented and created by many humans for many reasons! While we have no clear idea of how cells gained mitochondria, we do know computers were made by many humans, with their own goals and aspirations for what a computer should be. Babbage wanted to create a computer to replace human workers, while Lovelace and Turing were simply passionate about the mathematics and logic behind computers. The idea of replacing human workers with computers persists even stronger today. \nWe need to also make sure students are not disillusioned by tech utopianism and tech solutionism. Many human problems are complex problems with a deep history. Turning a human problem into a technical problem may seem like you're solving the human problem, but you may end up \"misunderstanding a human problem, introducing a new problem, which shifts the focus and gatekeeps\" and causes harm. An example is a website built by two Harvard students that tried to house refugees from Ukraine. When seemed like a good product was full of security holes and bugs ready for exploitation. For instance, \n\nlax security measures have also exposed the private data of the hosts opening their homes to refugees, allowing anyone to see information including hosts’ phone numbers and email addresses with a few clicks.\n\nMedia also worsened the situation by praising this hacked together website, shifting focus away from those the ground work. Not only was the product a privacy and security nightmare, but it showed how clueless it's creators were about relocating refugees. \n\nIn an interview with Gizmodo, Chojecka also said she had a problem with the site’s lack of education about the refugee experience for hosts, the fact that it did not translate listings into multiple languages, and that it had listings from places as far away as the U.S.\n\nThank you for your unexpected attention to my latest post about @AviSchiffmann and his (in our opinion) website UkraineTakeShelter which we consider unethical and harmful to refugees that we are currently dealing with (over 1 mn traumatized people entering the country).— Kasia Chojecka (@chojecka_kasia) March 9, 2022 \nTech is also not neutral. The operating system you are using today not only determines how fast your applications are or how many you can open at once but also which tech company you’re giving your personal information to. Companies want your data and students should understand what this means. \nCritically Conscious Computing gives a wonderful overview of the ethics and history of computing, whether it be how algorithms can oppress, how binary bits reduce people to categories, or how the first computers and operating systems came about. Design Justice also gives insight into how choices can harm individuals, and lastly, Programmed Inequality discusses how women helped create the field of computing and computers, only to be forgotten as computing turned into a male dominated field. These books and their authors explain the area of ethics and history much better than I can in a blog post. I highly recommend you read their works. \nEnd\nTeaching only code is like only teaching someone lab skills. Of course, someone will eventually discover which two reactants will produce the desired product by trial and error, but they will have a lacking understanding of why a chemical reaction works. As the saying goes; “Give a Man a Fish, and You Feed Him for a Day. Teach a Man To Fish, and You Feed Him for a Lifetime”.\nBecause let’s face it; what goes up must always come down. Teaching skills today does not always mean these skills will be useful in the future. Tech has gone through many big booms; first C, Java, JavaScript, AI, and now Web3. Who knows what is next? But something that will stick with us for a long time is the computer. \nReferences and inspiration:\n\nFast Food Education\nCritically Conscious Computing\nFILE NOT FOUND\nTeaching creative computer science: Simon Peyton Jones at TEDxExeter\nMy thoughts on hackathons\n\nUpdates: typos and making metaphors with chemistry less confusing and fixing weird grammars.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/compsci/computers/","title":"Everyone should learn about computers, not coding"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/compsci/cs-edu/":{"body":"Originally named: Thoughts based on my path to CS, and opinions on CS Education\nWhen I was in my first year of university, I started to believe that I wasted my time in high school; I wished that I started learning about computer science sooner. I had invested a lot of time into chemistry in high school and then pivoted to majoring in computer science in university. These two subjects don't have much in relation at all. It seemed like while everyone else (in computer science) was learning about AI and web development, I was busy learning chemistry and other IB-related things (English IB HL people know how tough this course was).\nBy the end of my first year, I was utterly confused. In class, we learned about graph traversals, proofs, and logic, but I kept hearing everyone talk about doing \"Full Stack\" development. So I decided to learn more about that and had a horrible time learning about it. I wasn't interested in HTML or JavaScript, and I didn't want to build websites; this lead me to believe that computer science was just building websites! I did some hackathons and tried learning stuff over the summer, but nothing stuck and I began to feel like this wasn't the path I wanted to take in university.\nAt the beginning of my second year, I was thinking of switching my major (which was currently in computer science) and going for a major in chemistry. That's when I started taking more chemistry and health science courses. And being in those chemistry classes was a fresh of breath air for me; no one talked about JavaScript, internships, or side projects. There was occasional talk about undergrad research, but the environment in health science classes was less stifling for me than computer science classes. \nI think a reason for this is because everyone in health science classes had more or less the same amount of knowledge. First and second-year chemistry classes were enjoyable for me because I had taken Chemistry IB HL. Biology, biochemistry, and microbiology classes were enjoyable for me because I had the same basis of biology and chemistry as everyone else. I didn't feel like I was very \"behind\" in the same way that I did in computer science classes. In my organic chemistry class, we were collectively confused, which is a nice feeling to have vs. being the only one confused.\nIn computer science, many of my classmates (mostly men) had already started programming in high school. They talked among themselves about topics I didn't understand and were able to easily answer in-class questions. It felt like a club I was shut out of because I wasn't spending time in high school programming. But when the midterm mark distribution came out, I was never terribly below average; sometimes above, and sometimes just average. So why did I always feel intimidated and out of place? \nI'm not sure. But now in my third year, I'm no longer sad that I wasn't coding away during high school because I enjoyed my time in high school. Chemistry will always be something I love. For the longest time, I couldn't justify taking courses in chemistry or biochemistry in university because I thought I should only spend money on courses that had better a return. Wouldn't it be better to spend money on a computer science course that could allow me to make more money, than a chemistry course that I was just interested in? I had this mindset for the first two years of my undergrad degree.This resulted in me flip-flopping between courses (never having a good timetable) and choosing courses that \"sounded good\", rather than if I actually wanted to learn about the topic. Eventually, I realized that I was wasting more time trying to force myself to like some courses; what would happen if I took that organic chemistry course instead of the databases course? Hopefully, nothing much, because I'm in that organic chemistry course right now. Additionally, I've found out that I'm interested in programming languages (how they are designed) and operating systems/compilers (how that programming language is turned into assembly and how hardware and software communicate with each other). So I don't think I'll be taking that database course.\nWhy I no longer wish that I did computer science in high school\nOne large reason I never ventured into computer science in high school was that I didn't have good resources near me. Out of all the women in my IB class, only 2 (including me) decided to not do a degree in the health sciences. In my daily life, no one I talked to talked about computer science. \nOne reason why I loved chemistry is that I had a wealth of resources near me to foster that passion. I started learning about orbitals in junior high and hand drew a periodic table that has hung in my room for 8 years. My father (who also shares the same passion for chemistry) actively encouraged my interests and gave me resources so I could self-learn at a young age. Additionally, the Science 10 (and junior high) curriculum had chemistry integrated into it, so I didn't have to do much self-directed learning once I entered high school. I also had friends I could talk to about chemistry, a teacher who was passionate about teaching chemistry, and an advanced curriculum in chemistry thanks to IB that went above and beyond the Alberta high school chemistry curriculum.\nOn the other hand, I didn't have any external factors for pursuing computer science. The computer science program at my high school in Calgary was unbeknownst to me (I didn't know if they had a computer science program at the time), my parents never really mentioned computer science to me, and no one around me was talking about computer science. I had never learned about computer science or even had it mentioned to me until my last year of high school, which was when computer science became the next hottest thing. \nI was scared that a major in chemistry would result in a futile career, which is why I decided to major in computer science. I don't like that this was the reason for me to set foot into computer science, but I'm glad this is no longer the reason that I'm staying. There are many reasons why I'm staying:\n\ncomputers can help us in many other areas, like drug research and DNA sequencing!\nthe way computers work is very interesting; it's both fragile and robust, like the way our bodies work. Crazy stuff.\nI like knowing exactly how something works. This is a reason why I'm interested in low-level computing/compiler/operating systems. Lots of abstractions hide the ugly details, but I like to know those ugly details.\n\nMany university courses helped me realize those reasons why I'm staying in computer science; CPSC 110 and CPSC 213. Not only did I enjoy the content, but the professors inspired me and interested me!\nCPSC 110 taught me so many concepts I didn't even know I was learning.\n\nI learned about data structures like graphs without even knowing I was\nI learned about linked lists without even knowing I was\nI learned about graph traversals\nI learned about program design\nI learned about test-driven development\nI learned about abstraction\n\nCPSC 213 was the course that FINALLY allowed me to understand:\n\npointers\nhow code becomes understandable to a computer\nhow and why a stack overflow can occur from too many recursive calls\nwhy we care about memory usage\n\nI'm excited about higher-level courses, and to also combine what I will learn in computer science with chemistry and biochemistry. I don't think learning computer science in high school would have resulted in where I am today. Taking my first computer science in university from a world-renown professor who tailored the course for years, has shaped the way I think about programming and computer science differently; I think about code in a more functional paradigm than an imperative paradigm. The computer science curriculum at my high school touches on OOP concepts and imperative programming before recursion and functional programming concepts. I'm glad I was introduced to functional programming concepts before imperative ones because this has made learning concepts in other classes much easier. The way a university lays out its computer science curriculum is more thought out than a high school one (I think, at least in high schools from Calgary), so this is also another reason I no longer regret how I spent my time in high school (learning about things I liked).\nI've always wondered if it would of been better had I been introduced to computer science through programs like KodeWithKlossy or SheCodes, which claim to fight the gender imbalance in computer science. With the points I discuss below, I'm glad I didn't partake in any of these programs, as I'm sure I would of actually been turned off from computer science.\nMy thoughts on \"minority\" focussed programs\nThere's many programs that are targeted towards minorities in computer science.  To me, most of them seem to almost be preying on this minority issue in computer science for their gain or don't seem to actually be helping. \nOne I don't particularly like is KodeWithKlossy. Their programs seem highly inaccessible to those who really need it and have a lacking curriculum. Their programs focus on web development and iOS app development. iOS app development is already inaccessible; only MacBooks can run the required software (XCode) that is needed to develop an iOS app. If you don't have access to a laptop, you sure aren't buying a MacBook as your first. I never (and still don't) have had MacBook, so that program would simply be out of my reach. And if MacBooks were provided during the program, I wouldn't be able to use those skills outside of the program unless KodeWithKlossy gave everyone a MacBook, which they probably aren't. Additionally, after looking at the final projects created for the web development program, they are very simple and don't highlight key areas of computer science like problem-solving (through algorithms), abstraction, or operating systems, to just name a few. I'm sure if I took KodeWithKlossy, I would not want to go into computer science because building websites is not very interesting to me.\nAnother reason why these programs are highly inaccessible is due to cost. For instance, one three-week KodeWithKlossy program cost 8795 USD. If the program ran for 3 weeks, 8 hours a day, this cost comes down to 52 USD per hour. \n\n\nIn comparison, the price breakdown for CPSC 110 at UBC: \n\n13 weeks of instruction\n3 hours of lecture per week\n3 hours of lab per week\ncountless instructor and TA office hours (not counted in the calculation)\n\nWould result in at least 78 hours, giving us 9 CAD per hour of lecture or lab. And this is not counting the many office hours students can get in addition to lectures and labs. And our professor has been shaping this course for years.\nIt is simply appalling for anyone to pay this much for a program that isn't even a college or university course.\nAnother program I don't like is SheCodes which to me seems to prey on women trying to transition to a career in tech by teaching them web development (people specializing in web development is increasing quickly, and the field is becoming very inflated. Telling people that learning web development will get them a job or high salary may not be true in a few years. I also personally don't like web development). Oh, and it's not free.\n\nThis quote drives the point home that programs like KodeWithKlossy don't seem to really focus on helping those who are economically unable to seek out CS education, but those who have the money; as long as there are women/gender minorities in our program (who can pay), who cares if they actually need help accessing CS programs or are the groups of people that need the most help? The curriculum also seems very shallow, focussing on \"hot\" skills like web development and iOS development (I tried finding a more in depth curriculum but I couldn't). Is that bad? I think so, but others may think not. Focussing on gender minorities frames KodeWithKlossy as doing good (and not harm). This trend is also seen in SheCodes and other boot camps.\nAnother issue is that these programs (KodeWithKlossy and SheCodes) mainly/only teach \"front-end\" web development, which is quickly becoming a woman-dominated field. Is that good? I don't think so. Historically, when women enter certain fields, it \"lowers\" the value of that field. Front-end development is now seen as \"easier\" than backend. I'm a firm believer that women should not pick up front-end development as their \"path\" into tech. Sadly, KodeWithKlossy and SheCodes capitalizes on the \"easiness\" of front-end development and shove it down women's throats.\n\nThe computing historian Marie Hicks can’t stand it when people tout coding camps as a solution to technology’s gender problem. “I think these initiatives are well-meaning, but they misunderstand the problem. The pipeline is not the problem; the meritocracy is the problem. The idea that we’ll just stuff people into the pipeline assumes a meritocracy that does not exist.”\n\nIf you do like web development, you can learn the same things KodeWithKlossy and SheCodes teaches (and way more) at freecodecamp FOR FREE. \nKodeWithKlossy does have a free version too, but I still think the curriculum and topics are lacking (only focussing on front-end for web development) and exclusionary (iOS development). I don't know much about data science but it's nice to see that as an area to learn about.\n\n\nNow, there are programs that I do think are doing a great job at introducing minorities in computer science to what computer science actually is. Jane Street has programs ranging from a few days to a few weeks teaching concepts like OCaml, probability, arbitrage, and even some business concepts! \nFrom their INSIGHT program:\n\nIn the software engineering program, students will learn about OCaml and the libraries and tools that we use in our everyday work, as well as the fundamentals of building electronic trading systems. Then, they’ll put these tools to use by writing the back-end and UI for a computer game and a program that trades on a simulated stock exchange.\n\nI really like their focus on using a functional programming language like OCaml, their mention of libraries (very important), tools (also very important), and also financial concepts (which I never got to learn and still haven't). These topics are not only super interesting, but involve topics in computer science like problem-solving, creating tested and robust programs (you would hope a trading system works correctly!), and involving the use of technology that can be installed on any operating system. The program also mentions learning about the back-end (which many boot camps/programs don't seem to dive into). Oh, and to my knowledge, this program is also free of cost. Below you can see the other types of programs they offer:\n\nFinal thoughts\nI think that computer science should be taught the same way as chemistry, biology, and physics for younger children. Learning physics doesn't mean you're a physicist, and that should become the norm with computer science. Also, when teaching a child science, you don't start throwing formulas and abstract concepts at them, you start with examples and talk about endeavours and discoveries done by humans in the field. \nComputer science should not just be taught as HTML and JavaScript, which is what many minority focussed CS programs are doing. We need to explore the rich history of computing! Just like how we learn about the models of the atom and different acid-base theories in chemistry in junior high and high school and then utilize models like the valence bond theory and hybridization in university, I think we should learn that computing begins from the invention of the abacus to human \"computers\" in WWII, and how we abstracted the human computer into the metal and inanimate computers we have today. \nComputer science can't keep being taught as just coding, and we should focus on other areas of computer science like operating systems, memory and data management, history and ethics and programming languages. Orgs focussing on young children should use Critically Conscious Computing as a basis for developing a curriculum. \nWe can't forget that computer science is also math; it's basically applied math, so we should also teach computer science in a similar way that math is taught. This would be the job for universities. Once younger students learn more about the history of computer science, learning the math behind computer science like recursion, graphs, operating systems, compilers, and more will allow them to make connections in what they learned when they were younger. I think the university curriculum at UBC is pretty good, but I am not qualified at all to judge that. This would have been the path to computer science I wished to take. Essentially, teach computer science like science to younger children, and then teach computer science like math to older children.\nBoot camps should seek with university professors and industry folks to deliver a condensed but in depth curriculum over a longer span of time. You simply can't learn computer science or coding in 2 weeks, or even 2 months. UBC's BCS program is a great program for older folks looking to enter software development, as this 2 year program cuts out all the annoying breadth courses a regular university student would take, while making sure core courses like Algorithm Design and Analysis and Computer Hardware and Operating Systems are included. The program is also at a comparative or even cheaper price than most boot camps, and offer a much higher quality of education.\nIf boot camps want to be the cheaper and quicker alternative to university, or if orgs want to educate young people on computer science, they must commit to delivering a well rounded education in computer science, or they are simply exploiting people for their own gain.\nUpdates: typos and added better photos. Changed to mainly/only teach front-end because there is now some focus on back-end but not really what back-end concepts. Added more to final thoughts.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/compsci/cs-edu/","title":"Thoughts based on my path to CS and Opinions on Minority Programs for CS"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/compsci/hackathons/":{"body":"I've attended a few hackathons, in-person and remote, and at first, a hackathon seemed like the perfect event. Free food, tech companies, and swag? What else could you ask for? Well, under all the free food and company shirts lies copy-pasted Stack Overflow code, dry eyes, and more. Attending hackathons now seems like a chore I need to check off as a computer science student. And frankly, I feel guilty for feeling this way. But after reading this blurb from Design Justice, this blog post from Jacky, and various other posts such as this, this and this I've realized that everything I feel towards hackathons is valid. For some context, I started going to hackathons in 2019 in my first year of university, so my hackathon experience may not match yours. These are purely my own experiences and may not reflect the majority of hackathon experiences.\nMy stomach and head hurt; all the health problems!\nWhen I attend a hackathon, I always plan for the next day to be a recovery day. From sore eyes to a constipated stomach, a throbbing headache, and back pain, that's the type of day I can expect right after a hackathon. The impact hackathons have on my health is a major reason I stopped attending. \nSomething like the hackathon diet always messes up my digestion for anywhere from a day to a week. I'm easily constipated by a lack of vegetables and a high intake of junk food. For instance, a hackathon diet made of a glass of orange juice and bagel, a few slices of pizza, and Chinese takeout is low in protein, vitamins, and minerals and high in fat, sodium, and sugar. And this is without the energy drinks and snacks one may eat throughout a hackathon. For me, a day eating at a hackathon causes painful bloating and constipation the next day. \nHackathons rarely offer healthy alternatives, aside from some fruit at breakfast, and it makes eating difficult for me. Yes, I could bring my food but that involves packing 3 meals, carrying those meals around, and making sure those meals don't go bad. And having healthy options is always a positive, as it's proven eating unhealthy food makes you think and respond slowly - everyone wants maximum brainpower at a hackathon, right?\nAdditionally, the lack of sleep nearly every participant will experience can cause anything from a slower cognitive response to a throbbing headache. Then there's the back pain from sitting all day and the dry eyes from staring at a screen. And leg pains from sitting cross-legged if you're me. A hackathon forces your body in awkward positions for hours. \nUnfortunately, this is what you can expect at 99% of hackathons. \nA dumpster fire of JavaScript, corporate APIs, AI, and stuff I don't understand from Stack Overflow\nI have a burning hate for JavaScript (I'm sorry). JavaScript with a couple of APIs from Google (hopefully a blockchain deep learning API) and Stack Overflow posts gives you the typical hackathon project. This type of project is \"built fast\" and breaks even faster. I also believe that hackathons perpetuate the cycle of using JavaScript for everything and anything (which I do not agree with). One might argue JavaScript allows for an idea to quickly turn into a product, which is true and very attractive at a hackathon. But if you want that JavaScript product to last, you're going to need a team and a lot of time just to maintain it. Now using another programming language like Reason might take longer to create a product, but the time needed to maintain and fix bugs in a project in Reason is almost none. \n\nMessenger used to receive bugs reports daily; since the introduction of Reason, there have been a total of 10 bugs (that's during the whole year, not per week)! \n\nand \n\nRefactoring speed went from days to hours to dozens of minutes. \n\nIn a world of exploding technological innovation, thinking about sustainability and maintainability is a must when building a product. And I believe using JavaScript is not the answer to creating sustainable or maintainable technology. This is my very personal opinion. Will I still work on projects with JavaScript, like at work? Unfortunately yes. But in my own time, I will be staying away from JavaScript as much as I can. \nAdditionally, I don't learn much by hastily copying a piece of code from Stack Overflow or using an API endpoint that does everything for me. And to be frank, there is no way I will produce any remotely helpful or useful in 24 hours. Much less so a functional product. Can some people do it? Maybe, but the vast majority of hackers have no understanding or a basic and lacking understanding of the context of an issue. This leads to my next point below...\nWhat are we trying to solve here?\nIt's funny how a microbiology class fundamentally changed the way I went about thinking about solving problems. In MICB 202, I learned about cholera, an acute diarrhoeal infection caused by ingesting water or food contaminated with the bacterium Vibrio cholerae. How would one go about reducing the number of cases of cholera? Well, by cleaning up the water. But how? Using chemicals? Using energy to kill off bacteria? While these are solutions, there's one thing we are forgetting about: the context of the problem, and those who are actually affected. The context is that the location (Bangladeshi villages) where cholera is still an issue is in places where water is used for everything, usually not being filtered or cleaned before the water is used. The water that people use to drink is also used for washing. So you can't just dump chemicals into the rivers and hope for the best. Additionally, there's a lack of resources. Who's going to synthesize chemicals and where would you even purify the water? Even boiling water would be a strain on resources (it would be better to use firewood for heating or cooking). To someone that is unfamiliar with the context of the issue, it's easy to slap a solution together and actually cause more harm than good.\nSo what was the solution the researchers came up with? The solution is quite simple and is a solution that can be easily adopted and pushed out into the public. It was to use a sari, a piece of cloth worn by Hindu women, but also now frequently worn by women of other religious groups. This solution is one I didn't even think of when my professor presented the case study in class. Why? Well because I didn't have a good or even basic understanding of the context of the problem, such as the cultural practices.\n\nIt is common practice in villages in Bangladesh to use cloth, frequently a flat, unfolded piece of an old sari, to filter home-prepared drinks. In laboratory experiments employing electron microscopy, we found that inexpensive sari cloth, folded four to eight times, provides a filter of ≈20-μm mesh size, small enough to remove all zooplankton, most phytoplankton, and all V. cholerae attached to plankton and particulates &gt;20 μm. Laboratory studies showed that sari cloth folded at least four times retained the V. cholerae cells attached to plankton, effectively removing &gt;99% (&gt;2 logs) of V. cholerae (30).\n\nHackathons occur very frequently in privileged Western societies that are so isolated from the world. This means the context of a problem is ignored, and this results in most solutions being useless, or even worse, harmful. Hackers go away with the feeling that problems are easy to solve and that technology is a bandaid for all problems, which is simply not true. These tweets below also offer insight into my thoughts:\nWant to help? Have technical skills? That's probably not a good idea. Here are some thoughts based on 10+ years seeing well-meaning technical folks getting involved in crises 🧵— Alix Dunn (@alixtrot) February 28, 2022 \nIn hard times, technology is intoxicating. It can feel like a shortcut to impact in a moment of impossible hardship. It's not. If you are getting high on your own supply, take a beat and think critically.— Alix Dunn (@alixtrot) February 28, 2022 \nThis is why I hate hackathons with a passion - they let volunteers do the fun part of the work and feel good about themselves, while sticking someone else with the burden of trying to implement and maintain something that's only half-done at best. (5/10)— Andrew Therriault (@therriaultphd) February 27, 2022 \nI've seen horrible takes on hackathon projects trying to solve a problem. One was an \"eating disorder diagnosis\" and \"treatment\" project, which was a static website involving the user filling in a multiple choice quiz (to determine if they had an eating disorder) and then very generic tips for someone with an eating disorder. \nFirst of all, anyone can have an eating disorder, and these types of quizzes can lead someone to believe they don't have an eating disorder when they do. \nAdditionally, generic tips like \"don't look at calories\" or \"make sure you are eating a balanced meal\" are phrases people with eating disorders can warp and bend into dangerous behaviour. If someone decides to stop looking at calories, they may just eat as little as possible because they live in fear of overeating and have no way to check if they are eating enough if they don't look at calories. Part of my recovery was calorie counting to make sure I was eating enough.\nAs someone who has had an eating disorder, I understand the intention is to help. But some things (like recovering from an eating disorder) cannot be solved with a web app.\nWe have to stop slapping code on everything and realize sometimes (most times), problems would be better off without the intervention of websites and phone apps.\nNot beginner-friendly if you don't already know how to do everything\nWhile hackathons are great places to be introduced to so many new concepts, are they the best place to learn and understand these new concepts? Hackathons celebrate this culture of \"move fast and break things\", and this implies that one must learn fast too. I don't know about you, but I don't learn fast, and especially not if I've been eating nothing but chocolate candy bars for the past 5 hours. Coupled with learning about something I'm not interested in, such as a company tool for a prize category, hackathons have made me lose the joy of learning about technology. It's also demotivating to see a team of highly skilled individuals who come into an hackathon with every move planned out; not everyone has the time to plan for a hackathon weekend. And I am not as skilled as someone who's been programming since high school. Always feeling \"behind\" others is partially why I felt like dropping out of computer science, which propelled my decision to pursue a minor in biochemistry a combined major in computer science and chemistry (more on that later). \nI'm a slow learner, and I'm slowly (haha) coming to terms with that. I'm also rediscovering the privilege of learning about things you're interested in for no goal but to learn about these things; I'm not trying to become the next Elon Musk. For instance, I've recently become interested in developer tooling like Semantic and strongly typed programming languages like Haskell and ReScript. I'm learning them when I feel like it and as slow as I want to. I'm also a chemistry nerd at heart, so I've added a biochemistry minor to my degree for no purpose but to nerd out in biochemistry changed my major to computer science and chemistry so I can nerd out in chemistry classes. \nSo what am I doing now?\nI'm not attending hackathons until I see that hackathons can become places where you are only expected to learn and to tinker, and there's no pressure to become the next startup or solve some worldwide (or local) problem. I've also stopped organizing hackathons. I'm also just learning topics that interest me, in my free time and at school.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/compsci/hackathons/","title":"My thoughts on hackathons"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/compsci/how-to-teach-cs-courses/":{"body":"Disclaimer: I'm just a student and teaching assistant for the courses I will be talking about.\nThis post was inspired by Amy J. Ko, Ph.D. and her book Critically Conscience Computing, and her talk Learning to Code: Why we Fail, How We Flourish. All the quotes are from Cracking the code: Why aren't more women majoring in computer science? and Critically Conscience Computing.\n\nMore and more students use a computer in their daily lives but have little to no understanding of the inner workings of a computer. Using a computer is like riding the bus; it's just how life is. You may use Google Docs because your school requires you to. Ignoring the capitalistic argument for pursuing computer science, I don't think many students are passionate or enjoy learning about computer science solely to just learn how a computer works. Rather, students want to learn about the vocational skills associated with computer science, while ignoring the theory. That may be because the link between computer science and society, or the impacts of computer science (besides Big Tech and AI, where there's a lot of money involved) is hard to see.\nIf we look at other sciences, like math or chemistry, the students in that major are more passionate about what they are studying. For example, chemistry is a large field, and as a chemistry major, you're required to take chemistry courses in a range of topics such as organic chemistry, quantum chemistry, physical chemistry, inorganic chemistry, etc. A chemist should have a basic understanding of the range of topics in chemistry because many areas involve more than one specialty. I've rarely witnessed students complain in my chemistry classes about a certain topic being \"useless\" because most students appreciate that a good chemist understands a wide range of areas in chemistry. Of course, someone may be more interested in applying chemistry, rather than learning the theory and engaging in research. For them, a degree in chemical engineering (which I've heard is very different) could be a better fit. \nBut it's different in my computer science classes. I see and hear frequent complaints about how a student will \"nEvEr tOuCh hArdWarE aGAiN\" and that they just \"hope to pass\" a course to graduate and move on to their Big Tech job. Then there are students who complain that a computer science degree was \"useless\" for their job in web development because they weren't taught React, JavaScript, and other web technologies. A good computer scientist will, like a chemist, have a basic understanding of a wide range of topics. Unlike someone who's more interested in applied chemistry, there's no \"Software Engineering\" discipline in most Canadian universities. There's only computer engineering and electrical engineering, which most computer science students would stay far away from since so many of them dislike hardware so much. There seems to be a large distaste for hardware from most computer science students. Anyways, this begs the question, of whether there should be another degree or \"pathway\" for someone that just wants to do web development, as that is what most software jobs are these days. Most software jobs seem to stress vocational skills, but computer science degrees in Canada are very theoretical.\nWith that being said, a computer science degree is still the most common degree for a software job. Since software is such an important and overreaching part of society, and I believe that just vocational skills aren't enough to get a job in software, because you must understand why something is the way it is or how something could fail. Nonetheless, a job as a software engineer requires coding and learning various technologies, with less emphasis on theoretical topics commonly taught in university. Should that be the responsibility of the university to teach these technologies over concepts? I'm not sure. But nowadays Canadian universities are teaching a mix of both for computer science, though much more emphasis on theoretical concepts. But how do we best teach theoretical concepts alongside programming language skills and proficiency?\nHow do we best teach theoretical concepts alongside programming language skills and proficiency?\nEducators like Amy J. Ko, Ph.D. hope that more people, especially from minority groups, can get involved in computer science. However, it's a challenge: even though there are more women in other areas like medicine and business than in previous years, you can't say the same for CS. Researchers from UCLA have pointed out: \n  \n  \n  Women who take intro-to-CS classes tend to be further along in their college careers than men, and they are usually not CS majors. Since women are better represented in CS intro courses (32%) than among actual CS degree earners (16% among BRAID schools), BRAID researchers believe that CS intro classes are particularly significant in whether a student chooses to go down the CS pathway.\n  \n  \n  Shana Vu, \n  Cracking the code: Why aren't more women majoring in computer science?\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n  Lehman stresses that students’ first impressions about CS are shaped by these introductory classes, especially because women, on average, are less likely to have taken a CS class in high school.\n  \n  \n  Shana Vu, \n  Cracking the code: Why aren't more women majoring in computer science?\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n  When it comes to programming, you first have to master how to learn programming, Lehman said. “So if [an instructor] just assumes that all the students have some background in coding, it can put some students at a disadvantage.”\n  \n  \n  Shana Vu, \n  Cracking the code: Why aren't more women majoring in computer science?\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n  Female students in these classes may also be made to feel as if they aren’t allowed to make mistakes.\n  \n  \n  Shana Vu, \n  Cracking the code: Why aren't more women majoring in computer science?\n  \n  \n\nAnother interesting point made by the researchers that I identified with was that:\n  \n  \n  “If someone stays in the major, it’s usually because they have strong peer connections,” she says. “When they leave, it’s not because they’re not capable, but it’s typically because they have this idea that CS does not contribute to the social good, and they want to help people.”\n  \n  \n  Shana Vu, \n  Cracking the code: Why aren't more women majoring in computer science?\n  \n  \n\nThis is one problem computer science educators are trying to solve: how do we relate computer science to a student's life? How do we show that computers can contribute to the social good? How can we make computer science personally resonate with a student?\nA student's first exposure to computer science is usually through programming. Most computer science courses you take will have a programming component, as did my first computer science course. However, in CPSC 110, I couldn't understand or see why learning recursion or coding up binary trees related to anything! After my first year, I was ready to leave my major in computer science for one in chemistry, where I had a dream of discovering drugs to cure diseases. Unfortunately, many other people may experience the same feeling of being divorced from their studies in computer science. \nIn Critically Conscience Computing, Amy J. Ko, Ph.D. talks about several ways programming is usually taught, and the positives and negatives of the different methods. Having TAed CPSC 110 and CPSC 210, and taken some computer science courses, I've noticed some differences between how programming is taught, and thus the differences in students' reactions to the course. \nCPSC 110 and CPSC 210 are based on teaching students a type of programming paradigm. In CPSC 110, students are taught to think in a functional paradigm, while in CPSC 210, students are taught to think in an OOP and imperative paradigm. Both courses tackle teaching students how to program in a particular paradigm with a different method: CPSC 110 uses problem sets and labs while CPSC 210 uses a self driven project and labs. I'll be discussing problem sets and self driven projects.\nProblem Sets\nAfter students go to a lecture, they must practice the knowledge they have learned to understand how to apply it. Simply reading or watching someone code does not imply a student can also code. The most common, consistent, and probably the easiest way to teach programming is through problem sets. Professors can also easily evaluate a student's ability to program through problem sets. Problems sets are also an easy way for an instructor to see a student's struggles and progress during a course because problem sets can be issued after every lecture, or at some consistent time interval, with questions targeting specific concepts or lectures. \nMost courses at UBC use problem sets to evaluate a student's understanding of course content. I'll define a problem set as a set of problems that every student works on, and there's usually one solution that the professor is looking for, though a few alternatives exist. There are usually some \"test cases\" that have to pass. There's some creative freedom in a student's answers, but they must pass these \"test cases\".\nCPSC 110 uses problem sets to judge a student's ability to do domain analysis and to apply the appropriate template to a particular problem. Students don't just get to pass the test cases though! There's some human graded portion and students are called up at least once throughout the term to discuss their solutions with the TAs.\nSince students will all do the same problem set, this ensures some level of fairness, since all students will be answering the same problems. However, as Critically Conscience Computing mentions, problems sets may be divorced from someone's life. Most problem set questions may involve questions like \"Traverse a tree numbers\" or \"Generate all the possible outcomes for a set of clowns\". If a student is not intrinsically already interested in computer science, these types of questions in problem sets are usually divergent from a student's interests and may make them less interested in computer science as a whole. I experienced this same feeling. I couldn't see or understand how these problem sets would give me skills to contribute positively to society.\n  \n  \n  Finally, because problem sets are often divorced from students’ lives, many students struggle to find a relationship between the abstract ideas of programming languages and their interests, values, and passions, limiting their motivation to learn.\n  \n  \n  Amy J. Ko, Brett Wortzman, \n  Critically Conscience Computing\n  \n  \n\nWhile problem sets ensure a student is up to a standard of knowledge (if they can complete the problem set correctly, this means they have understood most of the material), they can feel rigid and impersonal to a student. Something even worse is that students, especially women, could struggle on a problem set and decide that since they struggled so much solving questions on a problem set they didn't feel any personal connection to, to not pursue any further students in computer science (that was me in my first year of university).\n  \n  \n  The result of this approach is that students often rapidly lose any self-efficacy they began with, struggling to design, test, and debug without guidance, often converging towards a fixed mindset that they were simply not a “born” programmer\n  \n  \n  Amy J. Ko, Brett Wortzman, \n  Critically Conscience Computing\n  \n  \n\nDuring my time TAing CPSC 110, students who struggled usually continued to struggle throughout the term. Students aren't allowed to discuss or ask about problem sets to TAs or other students, meaning much of the problem set must be solved by themselves, without much guidance. Thus, students who struggled on the first problem set usually struggled on the next and the next ones, with some students eventually dropping the course.\nA possible solution to helping students' feel more personally engaged with programming is to center a course around being project-based, which I will discuss below.\nAmy J. Ko, Ph.D. also discuss how students may have a brittle understanding of the programming language, further impeding their ability to complete problem sets. I think that CPSC 110 tries to remedy this problem by using BSL (Racket), a programming language designed for educational purposes that has a very simple syntax and one that many students have never encountered before, leveling the playing ground.\nProject-based courses\nProject-based courses aim to offer a personalized and individualized component for the student. Students can conceptualize their project, usually adhering to some rules that require using a certain programming language or implementing concepts like object-orientated design. \nIn CPSC 210, students were very excited to discuss with me what they wanted to build. This is probably one of the most exciting things about computer science: building things! My office hours also felt different in comparison to CPSC 110. During my TA office hours, students also came to me to fix a bug in a feature they were implementing. They talked about \"fixing the bug that adds something twice to my shopping cart\" rather than \"I don't understand how recursion works.\"\n  \n  \n  This approach overcomes many of the problems of direct instruction, because when students encounter problems with their programs, students might see those problems as authentic challenges of realizing their vision, rather than failures to meet a rigid, instructor-defined notion of success. There is substantial evidence that student-driven project-based learning greatly improves interest in CS, motivation to learn, and engagement, and some evidence that this is associated with increases in student learning of programming language concepts.\n  \n  \n  Amy J. Ko, Brett Wortzman, \n  Critically Conscience Computing\n  \n  \n\nHowever, students who are \"beginner\", meaning they didn't program outside of university have the extra challenge of learning a programming language, in CPSC 210's case this would be Java. Coupled with creativity, this can be what makes a project flop.\n  \n  \n  Because students creatively explore their vision by modifying code, this brittle understanding of a programming language’s rules may also make it harder to change a program, because students may not understand precisely how their code is executing, limiting a students’ ability to realize their vision. Finally, and perhaps most significantly, because learning new programming language features is difficult, students with a fixed mindset may start with elaborate visions, realize that they have to learn particular language features, and then reduce their vision to avoid learning. \n  \n  \n  Amy J. Ko, Brett Wortzman, \n  Critically Conscience Computing\n  \n  \n\nOver my two terms TAing CPSC 210, I've always witnessed a student's vision for their project become less and less than what they had described to me. Many students begin designing their projects before having an adequate understanding of the programming language they are using, so many students inevitably overshoot on their projects. Of course, many of us over plan what we can do, but for a student who is new to programming, this can mean that a student simplifies their program based on the level of their understanding of the programming language, resulting in \"superficial programs that, while enabling students to express their interests to some extent, do not necessarily result in a robust or comprehensive understanding of a programming language, ultimately limiting their learning.\"\nHaving marked over 100 student projects, I have observed many students' progress in learning OOP and Java throughout the course. Since projects are usually larger assignments, students will get the entire term to work on them. But unlike a problem set with clear questions that point you towards what concepts you should be applying, a project, self-guided by the student, doesn't hold this same rigor. Even though students learn about Maps, they may just stick with two arrays, because they know how arrays work. I will usually not see students apply many of the new concepts they have learned in lectures. This troubles me because then I'm not sure if they will be able to apply these concepts in higher year courses. Another crucial concept of OOP includes Design Patterns, which students were encouraged to implement in their projects. However, since many students had working code without design patterns, many chose to not try and add a design pattern to their project. However, shouldn't grading catch this? \nBut it's also hard to grade a project, depending on how much creativity was allowed. For some projects, like a library system, the most complex data structure required is an array or linked list. For but a toy file system, someone may have used an n-ary tree. But should the array user student get a lower grade than the n-ary tree student? For CPSC 210, this meant grading was very lax, allowing students to get very high marks based on a very bare-bones rubric, which masked their lack of understanding of the course content. The grading rubric was so forgiving that projects with differing levels of complexity and concepts from class in them were given the same mark.\nI have witnessed that students enjoy CPSC 210 more than CPSC 110. However, should student enjoyment be prioritized over knowledge acquisition and knowledge application? Is it okay that students leave the course with different levels of knowledge?\nProject-based courses that have stricter rubrics or are \"pre-designed\" by the professor seem to be able to rectify issues like inconsistent projects between students and ensure all students are applying the same concepts learned in the lecture. But this then removes the creativity aspect of projects, which can make students feel the same way they did with problem sets.\nProgramming languages as vessels to teach concepts?\nSomething I've noticed in all my computer science courses is how \"programming languages are vessels to teach a concept\". This means the course doesn't focus on all how a programming language works, the semantics, and the rules. It seems to be the idea that students are either able to quickly pick up the programming language or that they are supposed to learn the programming language outside of class.\nHowever, it's difficult for some students to understand a concept and apply it because they have the barrier of also learning the programming language. I nearly failed an assignment in my data structures and algorithms course because I was having so much trouble with C++. I didn't understand how memory was being allocated and freed and how to use pointers. But did this mean I understood the concepts? I'll never know.\nFor chemistry courses, we have dedicated lab instructors teaching us laboratory concepts. But in computer science, students are left to themselves to learn and understand a programming language. CPSC 110 had lots of active programming in lectures and TAs who would catch people who were just passively watching without coding on their laptops. In other courses, the instructional team didn't care what students were up to during class.\nProfessors inevitably need to choose a programming language to use as a vessel to teach a concept, but having to program in a new programming language can make someone believe they aren't understanding the concepts, ultimately making them believe they aren't good at CS.\nNot teaching the programming language students must use can leave students feeling like learning a new programming language is supposed to be easy (hence no time spent on it in class) or simply cause a student to fall behind because they don't have the time to learn a new programming language in addition to completing assignments.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/compsci/how-to-teach-cs-courses/","title":"Comparisons of how CS Courses are taught at UBC"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/compsci/minority-programs/":{"body":"Extracted into it's own post. Is also part of this post, but I think this could also stand on it's own.\n\nThis is inspired by Critically Conscious Computing, and I take quotes from that book.\n\nThere's many programs that are targeted towards minorities in computer science.  To me, most of them seem to almost be preying on this minority issue in computer science for their gain or don't seem to actually be helping. \nOne I don't particularly like is KodeWithKlossy. Their programs seem highly inaccessible to those who really need it and have a lacking curriculum. Their programs focus on web development and iOS app development. iOS app development is already inaccessible; only MacBooks can run the required software (XCode) that is needed to develop an iOS app. If you don't have access to a laptop, you sure aren't buying a MacBook as your first. I never (and still don't) have had MacBook, so that program would simply be out of my reach. And if MacBooks were provided during the program, I wouldn't be able to use those skills outside of the program unless KodeWithKlossy gave everyone a MacBook, which they probably aren't. Additionally, after looking at the final projects created for the web development program, they are very simple and don't highlight key areas of computer science like problem-solving (through algorithms), abstraction, or operating systems, to just name a few. I'm sure if I took KodeWithKlossy, I would not want to go into computer science because building websites is not very interesting to me.\nAnother reason why these programs are highly inaccessible is due to cost. For instance, one three-week KodeWithKlossy program cost 8795 USD. If the program ran for 3 weeks, 8 hours a day, this cost comes down to 52 USD per hour. \n\n\nIn comparison, the price breakdown for CPSC 110 at UBC: \n\n13 weeks of instruction\n3 hours of lecture per week\n3 hours of lab per week\ncountless instructor and TA office hours (not counted in the calculation)\n\nWould result in at least 78 hours, giving us 9 CAD per hour of lecture or lab. And this is not counting the many office hours students can get in addition to lectures and labs. And our professor has been shaping this course for years.\nIt is simply appalling for anyone to pay this much for a program that isn't even a college or university course.\nAnother program I don't like is SheCodes which to me seems to prey on women trying to transition to a career in tech by teaching them web development (people specializing in web development is increasing quickly, and the field is becoming very inflated. Telling people that learning web development will get them a job or high salary may not be true in a few years. I also personally don't like web development). Oh, and it's not free.\n\nThis quote drives the point home that programs like KodeWithKlossy don't seem to really focus on helping those who are economically unable to seek out CS education, but those who have the money; as long as there are women/gender minorities in our program (who can pay), who cares if they actually need help accessing CS programs or are the groups of people that need the most help? The curriculum also seems very shallow, focussing on \"hot\" skills like web development and iOS development (I tried finding a more in depth curriculum but I couldn't). Is that bad? I think so, but others may think not. Focussing on gender minorities frames KodeWithKlossy as doing good (and not harm). This trend is also seen in SheCodes and other boot camps.\nAnother issue is that these programs (KodeWithKlossy and SheCodes) mainly/only teach \"front-end\" web development, which is quickly becoming a woman-dominated field. Is that good? I don't think so. Historically, when women enter certain fields, it \"lowers\" the value of that field. Front-end development is now seen as \"easier\" than backend. I'm a firm believer that women should not pick up front-end development as their \"path\" into tech. Sadly, KodeWithKlossy and SheCodes capitalizes on the \"easiness\" of front-end development and shove it down women's throats.\n\nThe computing historian Marie Hicks can’t stand it when people tout coding camps as a solution to technology’s gender problem. “I think these initiatives are well-meaning, but they misunderstand the problem. The pipeline is not the problem; the meritocracy is the problem. The idea that we’ll just stuff people into the pipeline assumes a meritocracy that does not exist.”\n\nIf you do like web development, you can learn the same things KodeWithKlossy and SheCodes teaches (and way more) at freecodecamp FOR FREE. \nKodeWithKlossy does have a free version too, but I still think the curriculum and topics are lacking (only focussing on front-end for web development) and exclusionary (iOS development). I don't know much about data science but it's nice to see that as an area to learn about.\n\n\nNow, there are programs that I do think are doing a great job at introducing minorities in computer science to what computer science actually is. Jane Street has programs ranging from a few days to a few weeks teaching concepts like OCaml, probability, arbitrage, and even some business concepts! \nFrom their INSIGHT program:\n\nIn the software engineering program, students will learn about OCaml and the libraries and tools that we use in our everyday work, as well as the fundamentals of building electronic trading systems. Then, they’ll put these tools to use by writing the back-end and UI for a computer game and a program that trades on a simulated stock exchange.\n\nI really like their focus on using a functional programming language like OCaml, their mention of libraries (very important), tools (also very important), and also financial concepts (which I never got to learn and still haven't). These topics are not only super interesting, but involve topics in computer science like problem-solving, creating tested and robust programs (you would hope a trading system works correctly!), and involving the use of technology that can be installed on any operating system. The program also mentions learning about the back-end (which many boot camps/programs don't seem to dive into). Oh, and to my knowledge, this program is also free of cost. Below you can see the other types of programs they offer:\n\nFinal thoughts\nI think that computer science should be taught the same way as chemistry, biology, and physics for younger children. Learning physics doesn't mean you're a physicist, and that should become the norm with computer science. Also, when teaching a child science, you don't start throwing formulas and abstract concepts at them, you start with examples and talk about endeavours and discoveries done by humans in the field. \nComputer science should not just be taught as HTML and JavaScript, which is what many minority focussed CS programs are doing. We need to explore the rich history of computing! Just like how we learn about the models of the atom and different acid-base theories in chemistry in junior high and high school and then utilize models like the valence bond theory and hybridization in university, I think we should learn that computing begins from the invention of the abacus to human \"computers\" in WWII, and how we abstracted the human computer into the metal and inanimate computers we have today. \nComputer science can't keep being taught as just coding, and we should focus on other areas of computer science like operating systems, memory and data management, history and ethics and programming languages. Orgs focussing on young children should use Critically Conscious Computing as a basis for developing a curriculum. \nWe can't forget that computer science is also math; it's basically applied math, so we should also teach computer science in a similar way that math is taught. This would be the job for universities. Once younger students learn more about the history of computer science, learning the math behind computer science like recursion, graphs, operating systems, compilers, and more will allow them to make connections in what they learned when they were younger. I think the university curriculum at UBC is pretty good, but I am not qualified at all to judge that. This would have been the path to computer science I wished to take. Essentially, teach computer science like science to younger children, and then teach computer science like math to older children.\nBoot camps should seek with university professors and industry folks to deliver a condensed but in depth curriculum over a longer span of time. You simply can't learn computer science or coding in 2 weeks, or even 2 months. UBC's BCS program is a great program for older folks looking to enter software development, as this 2 year program cuts out all the annoying breadth courses a regular university student would take, while making sure core courses like Algorithm Design and Analysis and Computer Hardware and Operating Systems are included. The program is also at a comparative or even cheaper price than most boot camps, and offer a much higher quality of education.\nIf boot camps want to be the cheaper and quicker alternative to university, or if orgs want to educate young people on computer science, they must commit to delivering a well rounded education in computer science, or they are simply exploiting people for their own gain.\nUpdates: typos and added better photos. Changed to mainly/only teach front-end because there is now some focus on back-end but not really what back-end concepts.

I think it is one of the hardest and most eye-opening computer science courses I've ever taken. Firstly, the course uses Racket, a programming language based on Scheme, that most people have never heard of before. (This is a good thing about the course - you're not at a disadvantage if you have never programmed before. Then you're taught to use design recipes. Sticking to a general template helps out with planning out solutions to those infamous Leetcode problems! And then finally, you must trust the natural recursion. Having learned about recursion in my first year made implementing recursion in CPSC 221 a breeze! And of course, Gregor makes sure you eat, sleep, and breathe recursion 🐄.\nWould I recommend?

Most CS majors try to postpone this course until the last year of their degree, but I personally was excited for this course. You see, I'm interested in systems programming, so this course was a lot easier and interesting for me than CPSC 320. \nThat being said, there are some aspects of the course I don't like. For one, the quizzes, throw in random C questions. For someone who doesn't do a lot of C in their free time, these questions can be quite the curveball. Another are the inclass exercises. I understand that practice makes perfect; you'll see me churning out a lot of practice problems. But trying to fit a 15 minute inclass exercise into a 50 minute lecture is a time crunch. Majority of the time, we either have the lecture material fill up the entire lecture time with no time to do the inclass, or we rush through lecture material to get to the inclass exercise (but then I don't know how to do the exercises because we rushed through the lecture!). \nAnother component of the course I don't understand is the tutorial. The tutorial involves some pretty bored TAs going over the question solutions at rapid speed. During the tutorial there are also live code interviews occurring in which you get called and you co over your lab code with a TA. This concept exists in CPSC 110 as well, but it is much better executed. In CPSC 110, you get asked about your problem set code from last week. In CPSC 313, I got asked about my assembly code from 3 weeks ago. I don't know about you but it's not very nice to have to try to understand and explain assembly you wrote three weeks ago. Overall, I think tutorial is very unneeded, because we already have preclass exercises, inclass exercises, labs and quizzes. \nAdditionally, for the first two midterms, I felt like I had a lot of trouble focusing and concentrating when doing examinations on PrairieLearn. For almost every question, I have to rewrite the question down onto my iPad to actually do the question. I felt this wasted a lot of time, time I wouldn't need to waste on a paper exam. I also really like to draw all over my paper exams (highlighting, underlining), since it's easy for me to lose where I am reading in a sentence; on PrairieLearn I can't highlight and underline. Secondly, my laptop frequently disconnected from UBC wifi, and this happened on the second midterm before I could save my answers, resulting in me clicking the Save button only to have all my answers erased, meaning I had to do the question again. Finally, the user interface is difficult for me to use. I frequently forget which question is which question, because the user interface on the assessment page only says \"Question X\" and not \"Question X: Ordering Memory\". Then I have to click through all the questions to find the question I want to look at.\nOverall thoughts\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/courses/cpscmath/cpsc313/","title":"CPSC 313"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/courses/cpscmath/cpsc320/":{"body":"Difficulty Rating: 8/10\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/courses/cpscmath/cpsc320/","title":"CPSC 320"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/courses/cpscmath/math100/":{"body":"Difficulty Rating: 6/10\nJust your basic first-year university differential calculus course.

To do well, you need to understand how different cycles can affect other cycles. Something happening in glycolysis does not only affect glycolysis, as it may affect the Kreb's cycle, which then could affect the ETC. To be able to spot such patterns and downstream affects, you should not only brute force memorize all the various cycles, but understand why each step in each cycle is needed. \nFor instance, in the first step of glycolysis, an OH group is exchanged for a phosphate group. This occurs because it will trap the glucose in the call. \nTo understand which steps are reversible and which aren't you look at the initial and final energy. If the reaction is exothermic, this step is probably not reversible. If the reaction is endothermic, it's probably reversible. \nAnd finally, to memorize all those enzyme names, my biochemistry professor told us that enzymes are named based on what they are doing; can you guess what the branching enzyme does? Essentially, if you can memorize enzyme names, it helps you understand what reaction occurs in the step, and vice versa.\nIt's all these little tips that helped me in this course. I typically don't like memorization, but a strong understanding of chemistry means you don't have to memorize as much.\nIf terms of assignments, this course has none!

It was all self learning, no lectures, just reading pages of notes on Canvas.\nOverall thoughts:\nIf you like going hiking, skiing, etc, this course may be for you. This course goes over cloud trends, weather trends, mountains, different types of snow climate (honestly I don't remember much). Unfortunately for me, I do none of those activities and I don't really enjoy learning about these topics, so this course was a waste of time for me. Additionally, I don't do well with memorization heavy courses (unless I really really like what I'm memorizing). This course being distance learning made it much worse. \nDon't take this course unless there is absolutely nothing else that interests you (if you're trying to cover science breadth) or if you're okay with memorizing stuff. Honestly, you could just ctrl-f through the notes and you'll pass for sure.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/courses/other/atsc113/","title":"ATSC 113"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/courses/other/dsci100/":{"body":"What to expect:\nOverall thoughts:\nI took the second iteration of this course, and I could tell the instructors worked hard to create a well-rounded syllabus.

That's something super important I keep reminding myself every day: you're here to learn and mistakes are bound to happen. \nI won't lie; when everyone around you has a master's/PhDs and you're just a second-year undergrad student, it can feel intimidating. But when I made a mistake or was unsure of how to do something, someone was always there to help me out. Someone was always available and willing to help me out, whether it be technical issues or more personal issues,  and that's what made this co-op term so great.\nAdditionally, I got to attend a bunch of presentations put on by other PROOF members! Such presentations included topics like SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) and biomarker research on diseases like asthma, allergic rhinitis, and pulmonary exacerbations in cystic fibrosis (super cool stuff that I barely understood).

If so, don't waste all your hard work! Now as a second-year student at UBC, I’ll now tell you how doing IB has impacted me and the mistakes I’ve made in choosing my courses as a first-year student.\n\nIntroduction to the IB\nIf you have never heard of the IB program, here's a brief explanation from the Calgary Board of Education: \n\nThe IB programme is an internationally recognized enrichment option for high school students. The program develops \"internationally minded people, who recognizing their common humanity and shared guardianship of the planet, help to create a better and more peaceful world\" (IB mission).\n\n\nThe programme encourages participation in creative and service-oriented actions, as well as personal and academic reflection, addresses intellectual, social, emotional and physical well-being and covers the curriculum required by Alberta Education and the IB programme.\n\nIn the IB programme, there are two levels of courses you can take: standard level (SL) and higher level (HL). Most SL courses cover your standard curriculum while HL courses cover some first-year university content. You must take 3 HL courses and up to 4 and then the remaining courses being SL courses. That is of course for full IB students - you take 6 courses total. Of those 6 courses, you must take one language, two sciences, literature, history, and math (at my high school). Full IB students must also take a Theory of Knowledge Course and submit an Extended Essay.\nThere are also partial IB students who just take a few courses (at least one humanity and one science/math at my high school). They do not need to take a Theory of Knowledge Course or submit an Extended Essay. \nThis guide will be most aligned with students interested in computer science! But you can general points in the TLDR. \nI took: \n\nChemistry HL, English Literature HL, History HL\nPhysics SL, Mandarin SL, Mathematics SL\n\nI’ll go into deeper detail about each course and the impact it has had on my two years at UBC.\nCourses I'm glad I took: \n\nChemistry HL\nEnglish Literature HL\nHistory HL\nTheory of Knowledge\nPhysics SL → I don't regret taking Physics SL, but I would have liked to take Physics HL (however I would take Mathematics HL over Physics HL, and that's why Physics SL is here).\n\nCourses I regret taking (and what I would replace them with):\n\nMandarin Ab Initio → literally any other language\nMathematics SL → Mathematics HL\n\nChemistry HL\nBy taking Chemistry HL, you can fulfill the lab and science requirements for the BSc. Additionally, if you are planning to major in life sciences, taking Chemistry HL will help you prepare for the university-level chemistry content, which is very different from what you learn in high school. With my credit from Chemistry HL, I skipped CHEM 121 and I went straight into CHEM 123, which was a breeze for me.\nEnglish Literature HL\nFor many people, English can be a demanding course, which can have the negative effect of also lowering your GPA. If you take English Literature HL you can skip 6 credits of the first year ENGL courses - that's your comminations requirement. For this meant I did not do any ENGL courses in university!\nHistory HL\nAs a BSc. student you need 12 art credits in addition to communications courses. Since I took History HL, I got 6 credits worth of HIST courses - that's already half of your required arts credits! \nPhysics SL\nI got 3 credits for PHYS 100, but I didn't need credits for PHYS 100. I would have preferred not to get credit for PHYS 100, but UBC takes all your transfer credit for IB or none. The 3 credits added towards my total credits taken which you can read about here. If you took Physics HL, then you would be able to replace PHYS 100 (3) and PHYS 1st-year level (3), with exemption from PHYS 101, which would also complete your lab requirements and allow you to register for higher-level physics courses. \nMandarin Ab Initio\nThis is more of a personal reason for me. I'm pretty white-washed, so I speak Mandarin at the level of a preschooler. But the thing is, teaching Mandarin at the high school level is just really hard for me. I wish I choose a language that used the alphabet instead, as I just couldn't grasp Mandarin fast enough. I still speak Mandarin at the level of a preschooler. You don't get any credit for taking an ab initio language.\nMathematics SL\nThis is probably the course I almost wish I took at the HL level. Math HL teaches you how to write proofs, which is something the standard high school curriculum is missing. Knowing how to write proofs gives you a leg up as a math or computer science student. Additionally, you can skip MATH 100 and MATH 101, and go straight into MATH 200 and MATH 221 (for computer science students)! But be warned that MATH HL is no easy feat. If you decide to take MATH HL you will need to put in the work. You don't get any credit for taking Mathematics SL. \nTheory of Knowledge\nFor full IB students, we are required to write a TOK Essay. You can read about that here: http://www.howtoib.com/writing-tok-essays/. I think TOK essays are super interesting, and if you get above a B on your essay, you can get transfer credit for 6 credits worth of PHIL courses. And with those 6 credits, I was already done my arts requirements as a BSc. student. \n\nOverall\nDue to my choices, I took only 7 courses in my first year. But even with such a light load, I was already done my arts requirements, lab requirement, and communications requirements. The downside to taking IB courses is that you can go over your credit limit(48, I think I had 47) due to transfer credits, which means you could not be able to be promoted to the second year. You can read more about that here: https://science.ubc.ca/students/requirements/promotion. \nHowever, make sure to check your university's policy on IB credits. UBC allows you to use all of your IB courses for transfer credit, whereas U of Waterloo has limits. But make sure you realize the hard work you will have to put in if you decide to choose HL courses. You are learning standard high school and first-year university content at the same time that other students are learning just the standard high school content. IB courses, whether they are SL or HL, also require IA (internal assessments) which are research-like papers.\nAm I glad I took IB? Of course! If I were given the chance to do high school again I would choose to do IB.\nTLDR\nCheck here for all the credits you can get for your IB courses: https://you.ubc.ca/applying-ubc/applied/first-year-credit/\nYou're a student who does not to want to take any arts electives:\n\nTake History HL, English Literature HL, any HL language course.\nIf you are a full IB student, score well on your Theory of Knowledge essay (at least a B) and you can get 6 philosophy credits (that's two courses).\nIf you're a BSc. you will have fulfilled all your arts requirements (including communications)\n\nYou're a student who does not to want to take any science electives:\n\nTaky any HL science in high school and you will get at least 3/4 credits if you score well on your IB exams!\n\nYou're a student is okay with arts electives, but you don't want English to drag down your GPA:\n\nTake English Literature HL or English Language and Literature HL. As a BSc. student you will have fulfilled your communications requirement. \n\nYou're a student who does not want to take any science electives with a lab components:\n\nTake Physics HL, Chemistry HL or Biology HL in high school and you won't need to do a lab science in uni!\n\nYou're a student who loves X (and you want to get straight into the higher level X courses):\n\nTake the HL version of X and you will be able to register into second year courses!\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/learning/ib/","title":"🎓 My experience at UBC as an IB Diploma graduate"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/learning/ipad-notes/":{"body":"My issues with handwriting notes\nI have a problem with note-taking. For as long as I can remember, by the time I reached the end of the semester, there are papers all over my desk; some useless, some useful. I also have a bad habit of using scrap paper for problem-solving, whether it be for MATH 200 or CPSC 320, but sometimes I do actually write down something insightful. But since it's scrap, I end up either losing that piece of paper or throwing it away 😅. \nFor my note-heavy classes, like biochemistry or microbiology, I went through notebooks so fast that I would have to carry 3 notebooks per class in my backpack. And sometimes I'd need to remind myself of this concept from 4 months ago, which meant spending a few minutes flipping through several notebooks, in hopes of finding that half-page of notes in 300 pages. \nAnd lastly, when I take notes in class there are a few other smaller and random issues:\n\nI sometimes bring questionable pens to write with. \nAnd then I make mistakes. I could use a pencil, but I don't like how it rubs off. This means I use white-out to correct myself, or even worse, I rip off a piece of paper, and tape it over my mistake. Which then makes my notes ugly, which makes me not want to read them.\nI don't want to ruin my notes by writing down in class problems to solve. In my computer science and math classes, it's common that we solve some problems in class. But since I don't know how much space I need to think and write out my solution, it results in some ugly notes, because if I leave myself not enough space, then I'm writing all over the margins of my notes. If I leave too much, it's just unused space. \n\n\nOk, why did I decide to write these notes in orange? I don't think I ever looked at these notes after I wrote them because they are kinda ugly.\n\nWhite out and notes in margins because no room.\n\nAgain, why the orange??? Was this the only pen I had?\n\nTaping paper over my mistakes.\nWhy not type up notes?\nI've only typed out notes for two classes: History IBHL and MICB 201. But when I type up notes, I don't feel like I retain anything. When I type notes, its more so that I can quickly search through them. This is useful for brute memorization courses in which I would search up a piece of information (like when the Sino-Soviet split occurred or the difference between gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria). For other courses like math, computer science, or chemistry, or less memory-intensive courses, typed up notes weren't that useful because I liked to draw out things and drawing out things with a keyboard or mouse wasn't appealing to me. \nMy Setup:\nI use GoodNotes as my main (and only) note-taking app.\nWhat I've noticed since using the iPad\nI read my notes more often, and it's easier for me to find a concept I need to study. I also have stopped losing my notes.\n\n\nWho is GoodNotes (and handwritten digital notes) for?\nI think the iPad is great for people who handwrite their notes or like writing down their ideas. It is a must for me to write down my ideas, especially for chemistry and low-level computing, because I cannot just think there and think of a chemical reaction, I need to try different pathways.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/learning/ipad-notes/","title":"🖊 My thoughts on using the iPad for notes"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/learning/racket/":{"body":"awesome book on creating languages in racket\nThese are my notes on creating programming languages with Racket. \nmaking funstacker, a functional version of stacker\nYou can find the full tutorial here.\n(define (read-syntax path port)\n  (define src-lines (port-&gt;lines port))\n  (define src-datums (format-datums '~a src-lines))\n  (define module-datum `(module funstacker-mod \"funstacker.rkt\"\n                          (handle-args ,@src-datums)))\n  (datum-&gt;syntax #f module-datum))\n(provide read-syntax)\n\n\nformat-datums takes the list of lines and changes it into data. \nfor funstacker, we just want to return the input as 1 2 + 3 * and change it into (handle 1 2 + 3 *).\nthat is what (handle-args ,@src-datums) is doing.\nnow we need to make the handle-args function.\n\nfor/fold\n(for/fold ([sum 0])\n          ([int (list 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10)])\n          (+ sum int))\n\nfor/fold iterates over a list of values and each pass of the loop also returns an accumulator.

The return value is the final value of the accumulator.\nFor the example above, the accumulator is sum and iterator is int. \nfor/fold has two mandatory parts, and two optional parts.\n\nat least one accumulator needs to be defined and every accumulator needs to have an inital value.\nat least one iterator needs to be defined.\n(optional) guard expression, which limits the iteration with a test condition.\n(optional) sequence constructor in-list. any sequence can be used directly as source of iterator values, including any list. \n\nmaking bf, the next step!\ntutorial here\nintro\nThe essential parts of a language are:\n\nreader\nexpander\n\nBut now we want to add grammer, basically allow us to specify the structure of a language. We need two new pieces:\n\nparser\ntokenizer\n\nTo use bf in racket: #lang bf-demo\nhow bf works\n\nwhen starting up: create array of bytes in memory (each byte initialized to 0) and pointer into that array (initialized to the 0 position). \nthe current byte is the byte in the array at the location indicated by the pointer. \nthere are 6 operations:\n\n&gt; increase pointer position by one\n&lt; decrease pointer position by one\n\n\nincrease the value of the current byte by one\n\n\n\n\ndecrease the value of the current byte by one\n\n\n. write current byte to stdout\n, read a byte from stdin and store it in the current byte (overwriting the existing value)\n\n\n\nThere is also a looping construct [...] that will repeat code within the brackets until the current byte is zero.\nRecall the two functions each language needs: \n\nreader: converts source file from string of characters into parenthesized S-expressions. read-syntax\nexpander: determines how the S-expressions correspond to Racket code. Starts with macro called #%module-begin\n\nClean, well-structured S-expressions makes writing an expander much easier.\nThe way we can convert any well-specified programming language into S-expressions is by using a grammar.\ngrammars and parsers\nparsing and parse trees\nparsing: converting source code from a format for humans into one optimized for a computer.\n\nthe data structure that emerges from the parser is a parser tree.\n\nIn Racket, a parse tree can be notated as an S-expression. A parse tree describes structure of code, but doesn't tell us how the code will actually run.\nif y &gt; 0:\n  x / y\nelse:\n  print(\"nope\")\n\n'(if (&gt; y 0)\n     :\n     (/ x y)\n     else:\n     (print \"nope\"))\n\n(if (&gt; y 0)\n  (/ x y)\n  (print \"nope\"))\n\nRacket looks similar to the parse tree!\nparsing power tool: a grammar\nIt makes more sense to use a parser generator to make a parser from a specification of the structure of the language (a grammar).\n\na grammar: way of notating the structure of every possible program written in that language.\ngrammar based parser is like regular expression, but it produces parse trees.\n\nwhy we should write a grammar vs. make a parser by hand.\n\nwe can use grammars that already exist, like Python's grammar, to make a Python-like language.\na grammar is a reality check; if we can write a grammar, chances are good that the language will work out. If we can't, it's a warning our language will have wrinkles (Markdown)\neasier to amend a grammar then hand-crafted parser. \n\nwhy we can't parse with regular expressions \n\nregular expressions treat strings as flat, sequential data\n\ngrammar notation\n\nconsists of production rules, written one per line. On the left of each rule is the name of the structural element. A colon goes in the middle of the rule. This notation style is known as EBNF. On the right of each rule, we have a pattern for that element.\nthe right side can include: literal strings, classes of strings, names of other production rules. Multiple possibilities are separated by |\n\napplying a grammar\n\nparser takes string of source code\nstarting with first production rule, parser tries to match source code to pattern on the right.\nif the pattern contains names of other rules of grammar, parser recursively tries to match those rules, again using patterns on the right.\n\nThis process continues until one of two things:\n\nthe parser decomposes source code into something that can't be further decomposed -&gt; terminals. A parse tree is returned (the leaves of a parse tree are always terminals)\nthe parser can't find any way to decompose source code into terminals; parse fails.\nIt's trial and error (parser could try lots of unsuccessful paths)\n\nambiguous grammars\n\nyou could write a grammar that can produce more than one valid parse tree for the same string\nbut you should avoid this\n\ngroups and multiples in patterns\na grammar for stacker\nstacker-program : \"\\n\"* instruction (\"\\n\"+ instruction)*\ninstruction     : integer | func\ninteger         : [\"-\"] digit+\ndigit           : \"0\" | \"1\" | \"2\" | \"3\" | \"4\"\n                | \"5\" | \"6\" | \"7\" | \"8\" | \"9\"\nfunc            : \"+\" | \"*\"\n\n\nparenthesizes create subsequences. \n* means zero or more\n+ means match one or more of the preceding item\n[] means zero or 1 of the enclosed item\n\n4\n8\n+\n3\n*\n\n'(stacker-program\n  (instruction (integer (digit \"4\")))\n  \"\\n\"\n  (instruction (integer (digit \"8\")))\n  \"\\n\"\n  (instruction (func \"+\"))\n  \"\\n\"\n  (instruction (integer (digit \"3\")))\n  \"\\n\"\n  (instruction (func \"*\")))\n\nnotes about how the parse tree lines up with the grammar:\n\neach node in parse tree corresponds to production rule, starting with name of rule followed by elements that matched the pattern for that rule\nrules that rely on other rules leads to nesting.\nevery character that appeared in original source string appears in parse tree.\n\nthe parser\n\nbf is just a list of operations and loops\n\nso the first line means: either bf-op or bf-loop and zero or more of\n\n\nnow define bf-op and bf-loop\n\nbf-program: (bf-op | bf-loop)* \nbf-op: \"&gt;\" | \"&lt;\" | \"+\" | \"-\" | \".\" | \",\" \nbf-loop: \"[\" (bf-op | bf-loop)* \"]\"\n\nand that's the grammar for bf! There are other ways to define the grammar but this is the easiest because bf-program only appears ones and it is the least number of rules.\nconverting a grammar to a parser\n\nwe will use a parser-generating language called brag that takes a list of production rules and turns those into a working parser.\n\nthe tokenizer\n\nsource string is converted to tokens\ntokenizer sits between source string and parser\na tokenizer is optional: if we don't use a tokenizer, then every character that appears in the source code counts as a token.\n\nSome tasks that are easily handled by the tokenizer?\n\nmeaningless strings in source code can be removed\nstrings that represent a value can be labeled with a generic token type\nstrings that should be handled literally can just pass through\n\nDownside to a tokenizer\n\nsubstrings removed (like comments) are invisible to the parser.\ntokens are indivisible; once we fuse a substring into a token, it can't be decomposed further by the parser. big tokens can be convenient because they reduce complexity, but they also reduce flexibility.\n\ndesigning the bf tokenizer\nThe bf grammar omits one detail: that any characters besides the eight used should be ignored.\n\nthe bf tokenizer is simple: pass through eight characters intact and toss out everything else\n\nwriting a reader with a tokenizer\n\ninstead of manually reading in strings of code from port, pass port to make tokenizer, which returns function that reads characters from port and generates tokens\n\nmake-tokenizer creates and returns a function next-token that parser calls repeatedly to retrieve new tokens\n\n\nuse those tokens with parse, to make parse-tree\ncreate module-datum and put parse-tree inside\nfinally use datum-&gt;syntax to package code as syntax object\n\ntokenizing rules\n\nhelper function: lexer\n\neach branch of lexer represent a rule: right side of token-creating expression, left side is pattern\neach time next-token is called, bf-lexer will read as many characters from port as possible while still matching a rule pattern (greedy matching).\nright side of rule with convert matched characters into token, which is returned\n\n\n\n(require brag/support) ;;

use function\nrearrange code in a way that a function can't -&gt; macro\n\n+[&gt;] will be parsed into:\n(bf-program (bf-op \"+\") (bf-loop \"[\" (bf-op \"&gt;\") \"]\"))\n\nour expander goes as follows:\n\ncall bf-program macro with two input arguments:\n\n(bf-op \"+\")\n(bf-loop \"[\" (bf-op \"&gt;\") \"]\")\n\n\ncall bf-op macro with one input:\n\n\"+\"\n\n\ncall bf-loop macro with three input arguments:\n\n\"[\"\n\"]\"\n(bf-op \"&gt;\")\n\n\ncall the bf-op macro with one input argument:\n\n\"&gt;\"\n\n\n\nfrom grammar to syntax pattern\n\nsyntax pattern is like a regular expression\n\nbf-program macro:\nbf-program: (bf-op | bf-loop)*\n(bf-program OP-OR-LOOP-ARG ...)\n\n\nbf-program denotes literal identifier in the code, and is name of macro. every element of a define-macro syntax pattern matches literally\nunless it's in all caps. \n\npattern variable: can catch everything\n\n\nthe ..., similar to * quantifier. used after a pattern variable, the ... gathers al arguments that follow. can also match 0 arguments.\n\nReturn value of a macro is a syntax template.\n\nwe return a void, which discards the arguments.\ndefine-macro-cases it's like a cond\n\na functional expander\nWe have two goals\n\navoid keeping state\navoid mutation\n\nTricky because bf by nature is imperative\n\nin funstacker we learned we can approximate behaviour of state variables by turning them into accumulators with for/fold\nwith functional programming idiom: model bf operations that take a current array and pointer as input and return new array and pointer values as output.\ninstead of storing state values outside the function, let the values travel through the functions\n\nrestarting the expander\n\nmodel new bf operations as functions that take two input arguments, array and pointer, and return a new array and pointer.\nwe want return value of a bf-func to become input arguments of the next-bf-func. \n\nbut bf-func only returns one value and next-bf-func needs two values.\nwe cure this mismatch by using apply\n\n\n\napply\n\ntakes a function and list of values as input, and calls the function while using those values as input arguments\nthese two expressions are equivalent\nkind of like takes the list apart.\n\n(apply func (list arg1 arg2 arg3 arg4))\n(func arg1 arg2 arg3 arg4)\n\n\nthe above example stipulates func is a run time function, not a macro; macros cannot be passed as an argument to any higher order function.\n\n(define (fold-funcs apl bf-funcs)\n  (for/fold ([current-apl apl])\n            ([bf-func (in-list bf-funcs)])\n    (apply bf-func current-apl)))\n\n\nfold-funcs: takes two input args, apl and a pointer; the return value of bf-func and list of bf-funcs\nwhen for/fold starts, it creates an accumulator called current-apl to hold current state of the bf program, and initializes it to the apl argument passed as input.\nthen it iterates over the list of bf-funcs\non each iteration it uses apply to pass current-apl as arguments to the next bf-func\nonce we run out of bf-funcs, the last value of current-apl becomes the return value of the for/fold loop, and therefore the fold-funcs function.\n\nnow we can write the macro for bf-program\n(define-macro (bf-program OP-OR-LOOP-ARG ...)\n  #'(begin\n      (define first-apl (list (make-vector 30000 0) 0))\n      (void (fold-funcs first-apl (list OP-OR-LOOP-ARG ...)))))\n(provide bf-program)\n\n\nwe want to return code for two expressions; syntax object can only represent one.\nany time we want to return multiple expressions: use begin\n\nunlike let, begin does not create a new scope for variables, any variables inside a begin are visible outside as well\n\n\nmacro should not return a value, so pass result to a void.\n\nnow we write the macro for bf-loop; there are two things to observe\n\nwhen bf-loop arrives at fold-funcs, it is expected to behave as bf-func. So the return value of bf-loop macro has to be a function that has two input args and 1 output arg.\nbf-loop is mini bf program that runs repeatedly until a certain condition is met.\n\n(define-macro (bf-loop \"[\" OP-OR-LOOP-ARG ... \"]\")\n  #'(lambda (arr ptr)\n      (for/fold ([current-apl (list arr ptr)])\n                ([i (in-naturals)]\n                 #:break (zero? (apply current-byte\n                                       current-apl)))\n        (fold-funcs current-apl (list OP-OR-LOOP-ARG ...)))))\n(provide bf-loop)\n\nthe last macro is bf-op, but instead of returning a self-contained function, just return only the name of corresponding function -&gt; so fold-funcs can apply a list of arguments to it.\nmaking it faster\n\nthis functional version is much slower because of the set-current-byte func\n\nwe make a new array every time, which is 30k bytes, and the garbage collector has to run more often to free up memory.\nto make it faster we can just use the input array\n\n\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/learning/racket/","title":"λ Racket Shenanigans"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/learning/rust/":{"body":"ch 1: getting started\nCargo.toml: manifest file for Rust. \n\nmetadata and dependencies\nsrc/main.rs where you write code.\n\ncargo new: generates a hello world program\ncargo run: run the program\nadding dependencies\nyou find libraries on crates.io, and packages are referred to as crates\ncargo-build to install the dependency.\n\nrunning this creates Cargo.lock, which is a log of the exact versions of dependencies we are using locally.\n\nhello world\n\nindent with four spaces, not tab\nprintln! is a macro;

Common Collections\n\nunlike built in arrays/tuples, these collections have their data stored on the heap, so the amount of data doesn't need to be known at compile time and data can grow and shrink as program runs.\n\n3 common types:\n\nvector: store variable number of values next to each other \nstring: collection of charterers\nhash map: associate value with particular key\n\nvector Vec&lt;T&gt;:\n\nonly store values of same type\nvec! macro which creates a new vector that holds values you give it\ndropping a vector drops it's elements\naccess elements through [] (less safe) or get() (more safe)\nsame rule of not being able to have mutable and immutable references applies for vectors:\n\nlet mut v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n\nlet first = &amp;v[0]; // immutable borrow\n\nv.push(6); // mutable borrow\n\nprintln!(\"The first element is: {}\", first);\n\n\n\ndoesn't work because of how vectors work: vectors put values next to each other in memory\n\nadding a new element onto the end might require allocating new memory and copying old elements into new space, then first would be pointing to deallocated memory\n\n\n\nString\n\nstring slice str or &amp;str\nStringtype: growable, mutable, owned, UTF-8 encoded string type\n\nString::from and to_string do the same thing\n\n\n\nlet s1 = String::from(\"Hello, \");\nlet s2 = String::from(\"world!\");\nlet s3 = s1 + &amp;s2; // note s1 has been moved here and can no longer be used\n\n\nRust strings don't support indexing\n\nString is wrapper over Vec&lt;u8&gt;\nindex into a string's bytes will not always correlate with valid Unicode scalar value\nif &amp;\"hello\"[0] were valid code that returned the byte value, it would return 104, not h\nthree ways to look at strings: bytes, scalar values and grapheme clusters\nindexing operations are expected to take constant time O(1), but it's not possible because Rust has to walk thought the contents to determine how many valid characters there are\ncan use range to create string slices, but can crash your program\nbe explicit if you want chars or bytes\n\nHash Maps HashMap&lt;K, V&gt;\n\nstore data on the heap\nways to construct:\n\nuse\n\n\n\nuse std::collections:HashMap;\n\nlet mut map = HashMap::new();\n\nmut.insert(String::from(\"Yeet\"), 1);\n\n\niterators and collect method on vector of tuples\n\nuse std::collections:HashMap;\n\nlet keys = vec![String::from(\"A\"),String::from(\"B\")];\nlet vals = vec![1,2];\n\nlet mut map: HashMap&lt;_._&gt; = keys.into_iter().zip(vals.into_iter()).collect();\n\n\nuses SipHash which provides resistance to DoS attacks but is not the fastest hashing function.\n\n9.

A few things include:\n\nstarting my first internship\nhelping organize StarHacks\nTAing for the first time\nturning 20 (and still can't drive)\ndoing the most nerve-wracking interview of my life\ndiscovered that I like IU's songs\nfinishing up my one course (that I did well in!)\n\nBut that’s just the tip of the iceberg.\nMy thoughts on hackathons have changed, and you can read more here.\n🌟 StarHacks\nWhen I received an email saying that I was chosen to join the StarHacks team in September 2020 I was so excited. Until I saw what team I was on: outreach. Before we go any further, I’ll explain why I felt that way:\nIn high school, I took English IB. But I was horrible at English; after hours of tutoring, crying, and revising, the highest mark I could muster on an essay was 75%. By some stroke of luck, I scored a 6 on my English IB exams. However, after dealing with years of getting low marks from essays, it was ingrained into me that I was just bad at writing. Maybe I was only good at objective things like science and math. And I became okay with that. \nSo when I saw that bolded “Outreach” in the email, I was scared. Outreach is all about explaining your ideas to someone to convince them that you're worth listening to. Writing is the same thing. How could someone like me be any good at outreach? For some unknown reason, I accepted the team invitation. \nAs the months went by, I realized that outreach wasn’t so bad. There is one thing I didn’t mention about the essays I wrote in English class. The essays that I got 75% on; well those were critical analytical essays in which we had to write about a novel or poem. When we got to write a personal essay about our life experiences, I scored 90% on those. And that’s what outreach soon began to feel like; writing a personal essay. \nYou see, StarHacks’ mission is to create a community for women and non-binary individuals in computer science. While I didn’t know it at the time, I'm the same as all the girls who attended StarHacks; the girl who was scared of C++ and felt like dropping from the CS major in the first year (you can read about that here). By writing newsletters, creating infographics, and talking with these girls and non-binary individuals, I could encourage them to try out CS. And that to me, is the entire reason why I decided to join the StarHacks team. Since being a woman in STEM is a large part of my identity, outreach no longer was something I dreaded doing. I’m excited to be joining nwPlus as a marketing coordinator and I'm looking forward to the impact that I can make!\n👩🏻‍💻 Career\nThe weeks leading up to my first co-op had me in a ball of nerves. Imposter syndrome struck hard and I couldn't stop thinking of thoughts like \"What if they regret hiring me?\" or \"What if I can't do anything?\". Fortunately, as I settled into my internship, I quickly forgot I had those thoughts in the first place! From learning all about biomedical text extraction, to even learning a bit about breast cancer, I've had a wonderful time at the PROOF Centre. You can read about that here.\nLess than one month into my internship, I got an email for a first-round interview from a company. I nearly fell out of my chair and I ran to my father to show him the email. I was in disbelief, and after my shock wore off, I started to feel scared. This interview was for a software engineer position, so I knew there was going to be some leetcode style questions. And at the time I probably did less than 10 leetcode questions, so I got down to practicing my data structures and algorithms. Amazingly, I passed the first round of interviews and was invited for a final round of interviews! The final round of interviews included three 45 minute interviews with three different members of the company. I remember how exhausted I was when I finished my last interview and I just ended up staring at my laptop for the rest of the day. And to my shock, I received an email telling me that I had passed the final round of interviews! \nI have to thank my boyfriend, Ryan, and my friend Jacky, both of which helped me so much with preparation. Ryan would video call me for hours every day to practice everything from my leetcoding to my behavioral questions. Jacky also freed up time in his very busy schedule to do some mock interviews with me. I can’t thank them enough! In the next few weeks, you’ll see what this company is (I’m still in shock about getting an offer).\n🏋️‍♀️ Health and Fitness\nUnfortunately, not all was good. With an increasing workload, and my decision to work two jobs, I became much less active. I also started skipping meals and working out on an empty stomach. Due to my eating disorder, I've developed digestive issues, so skipping meals caused me a lot of stomach pain. \nIt's also been a year since I lifted anything heavier than 50 lbs. And I'm going insane. The gym has always been a place for me to zone out, but being at home makes that a lot harder. With a lack of equipment, working out just didn't seem fun anymore. Since I could just run upstairs if I got an email from work, working out was no longer me time, but something I did to make sure I got in my daily exercise.\nAfter realizing how unfit I had gotten, I did the unthinkable; I started to run again. I quit the cross country in high school and never looked back, so running was something that I didn't think I'd ever do again; at least not every day. For the past month, I've been running anywhere from 20 to 40 mins a day, along with some calisthenics. And I feel better. Running is no substitute for weight lifting, but running allows me to zone out and ignore the world for a while. \n\n\nA typical Monday to Friday.\nWhile physical health and nutrition are super important to me, my eye health and brain health are easily left on the back burner. I've had days where my eyes are so sore I have to pause every few minutes to just close them. Being nearsighted doesn't make my horrible eye health any better. I hope to start implementing some healthy eye habits because I do take my eyes for granted.\n🤔 Life\nDespite being 20, I still feel like an 18-year-old who just finished high school. I still can't drive, have never tried alcohol, and live at home (though I don't mind this one too much). Some of that can be attributed to the pandemic. While the pandemic sucks, I've gotten into the habit of having friendly debates with my dad, running terminal commands on my brother's laptop to look cool 😎, and more chats with my mom. And I'm very grateful for that.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/life/33-percent/","title":"🤔 1/3 of 2021"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/life/eating-disorder/":{"body":"TW: Mentions of exercise, diets, eating disorders\nI had forgotten about my eating disorder and body dysmorphia until the pandemic started in 2019. Suddenly, all the gyms were closing one by one, and I was slowly getting more and more nervous. Maybe some people rejoiced when the gyms closed, \"Yay, no more annoying 6 AM gym for me!\". The majority probably felt mildly annoyed, with thoughts of trying to get their money back or having to put aside that PR for another gym session. But I was terrified. My safety net was ripped away from me. All the thoughts of my eating disorder and body dysmorphia were back. I started skipping breakfast and eating less. I drank cups and cups of water to make myself feel full. I would get mad at myself if I didn't exercise, and I forced myself to go running again. I hated this feeling.\nI still feel like this today. Even more so. With COVID-19 now being a constant in our society, I not only feel anxiety from my eating disorder and body dysmorphia but from the people caring less and less about preventing the spread of COVID-19. Maybe you're thinking that COVID-19 isn't that serious and that I'm paranoid. You can think what you want; maybe go tell that to people who had Polio. Tell them Polio \"wasn't serious\". Or those who have HIV. Tell them, \"It isn't that serious\".\nI've lost my safe space. It now becomes a horrible gamble every time I want to go to the gym. Is it worth getting COVID-19 to do a gym session today? It is worth my mental sanity at the cost of getting myself and my loved ones sick? I guess most people don't care. I struggle to understand why the gym employees don't take vaccination checks seriously, sometimes not even verifying the QR code is legitimate. I struggle to understand why someone can't put on a mask for an hour for the gym. Because let's be honest, you're not even doing something so intense that a mask would inhibit you. I've lifted 200 lbs off the ground with my N95 mask. I can do pull-ups with my N95 mask. The Canadian women's hockey team played their game in N95s. So stop complaining about masks. \nSince I don't want to go into a room of human sweat and spit during COVID-19, I run outside. Running is a reminder of my eating disorder and body dysmorphia but it's better than not exercising at all. It's a compromise of getting in a worse workout, but at the benefit of almost 0% of me catching COVID-19. If I can make sacrifices, so can you. \n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/life/eating-disorder/","title":"my eating disorder and mental health during COVID-19"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/life/end-2021/":{"body":"Turning 20\nI feel like it's more common for a university student in Vancouver to not have a driver's license than to have one. My parents told me the longer I wait to get my driver's license, the harder it would be, since learning how to drive at an older age was harder. But I don't see a reason to learn how to drive, because taking the bus is easier in Vancouver than in Calgary and I don't have access to a car. \nBut I guess now I'm in my early 20s? It still feels like I'm 16; kinda excited for the world but also kinda scared. These days it's leaning more towards feeling more scared than excited. \nI think I might have taken on too much; thinking about my education\nI was excited to get back to you in person. I was even more excited when I got a TA offer for CPSC 110. I was even more excited to take my first biochemistry class and CPSC 213. But I took on too much this term. I was also involved with 3 side projects, one being part of the nwPlus team, another being part of the StarHacks team, and lastly one side project that I had to drop out of. I was tired every day, exhausted, and could barely focus. My sleep varied anywhere from 5 hours to 9, and I felt the effects of an inconsistent sleep schedule. I also felt like I didn't have enough time to study, but let's see if that's true. \nFor reference, per credit, you should dedicate 2-3 hours of study time per week. Most of my courses were 3 credits, so I should be spending 9 hours per week. I had one 4 credit course, CPSC 213, and that course would expect around 12 hours per week of study. I'm choosing the upper bounds because I struggle with computer science and math courses.\nLooking back on time spent per subject, it seems to me like I spent:\n\nCPSC 213: 135 hrs total, 10.38 hrs/week\nMATH 200: 129 hrs total, 9.92 hrs/week\nCPSC 320: 110 hrs total, 8.46 hrs/week\nBIOC 202: 91 hrs total, 7 hrs/week\nMICB 306: 68 hrs total, 5.23 hrs/week\n\n\nAll data were calculated from September 7th to December 7th (13 weeks). I'm surprised that I did spend enough time on my CPSC and MATH courses, but I felt like I was always behind in them. On the contrary, I wasn't spending nearly as much time in my BIOC and MICB courses, but I always felt like I knew what was happening and I never fell behind too badly in those courses. I guess this means I'm not studying very efficiently in my CPSC and MATH courses. That's something I'm going to have to think about; how I can efficiently and effectively study in CPSC and MATH.\nThinking about my future\nWorking at Microsoft changed what I wanted to do after I graduated. I didn't have the best time, (maybe I'll write about it), and had some breakdowns that are related to how I felt about my experience at Microsoft. To keep it short and simple, I didn't like the corporate world. Someone who helped me get through the time at Microsoft, and someone I look up to, led to me reading this article and watching this video. Again, to put it short and sweet, there was someone on our team that required me to give a lot, and I broke down in the process. Even better (well actually worse), I interviewed to return to a health and tech-focused team at Microsoft, but was rejected because my project was lacking technically; since my project wasn't technically challenging enough, the health team decided that I was lacking in technical skills, in comparison to other candidates. To say I was crushed at the time would be an understatement. Not only was I slightly embarrassed, but this meant if I took my return offer, I would have to work within the Teams organization (ew). I was left pretty soured by this experience. \nAnother aspect of just corporate in general (and maybe Garage Program-specific) was that I just felt like I was working on useless sh*t that would never see the day of light. I need to see my work make an impact, and I just felt like this project was something to keep the interns busy. Even worse, the entire project was done in JavaScript and C#, basically the last two programming languages I'd choose to work with.\nWhat was pretty awesome was that I bonded and become close friends with two students from U of T, and we talk to this day about anything that comes to our mind. We also played a bunch of Overcooked during our internship 😳.\nI think going to grad school for biochemistry, computer science or biomedical engineering would be cool, but my grades aren't the best, so I'm not sure if that is the path I can take.\nOn my appearance\nThis year I kinda did something wild (for me). I dyed the inside parts of my hair blue and got my lobes double pierced. I've been thinking about making these changes for at least a year and telling my boyfriend about it every day. And when I got it done, I liked how it changed my look. Maybe I'll dye my hair again?? But I had to sit for around 5 hours, and that was quite painful, so maybe I'll dye my hair once a year. \n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/life/end-2021/","title":"🐈 so 2021 is done"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/life/leaving-extrac/":{"body":"CW: swearing, breaking down, negativity\nBeginnings\nI think it was in my first year that I attended my first hackathon and that's when decided it would be cool to be behind the scenes of a hackathon. \nSo that's when I decided to try applying to hackathon organization teams. In my first year, I tried my hand at joining a development team and was rejected. My boyfriend was accepted and was involved in the team for a year. I'm glad I was rejected; the development work was not something I was interested in (At the time in my first year, I was trying to get any experience, and didn't really care what experience it was) and my boyfriend was even less interested in it (but was the one who had to do it, unfortunately). Also, the whole aspect of group work is awful, because if no one's doing it then shit doesn't get done; I would often see my boyfriend doing most of the work. And in fact, to this day he's still a top contributor on some project repositories even though he hasn't touched the code base for more than a year.\nAnd that led me to be more interested in the logistics of hackathons. I had a small moment after my first year; I missed chemistry and it was hard to see why I should have stayed in computer science because I was a slow learner (in high school, I was among the top students in my chemistry class and in my first-year chemistry classes I got A+, so I wasn't used to struggling as I did in computer science classes) and the weird culture of computer science students thinking they were on the verge of something or that they were the future; no JavaScript and AI isn't going to change the world as you would hope so. So I decided I'd rather be involved in encouraging more minorities to pursue computer science alongside another field, which is where I am today studying computer science, biochemistry, and chemistry.\nGetting into... Marketing?\nAnyways, I then applied to join the operations team at StarHacks, putting marketing as my backup. I wanted to gain some experience before applying to the cmd-f logistics team at nwPlus. I was accepted, but for marketing to my dismay. Since this would be the first hackathon I'd be involved in, I said yes to the opportunity. And I'm glad I took the opportunity and I did so much more than marketing. I loved everything about the role at StarHacks; the group of minorities I helped inspire, the people I worked with, managing a Discord server, playing with Discord bots, and creating and researching new content to promote. But I hated marketing; monitoring social media accounts was the last thing I ever wanted to do. Unfortunately, that was my role on the team. I wanted to plan out workshops, pick inspirational speakers, and shape the way someone was introduced to computer science. I wanted to show that computer science was more than coding; it was the way computers can communicate with another computer, how the hardware and software communicate, how the individual could communicate with the software and trust that the software would communicate correctly with the hardware, theories of computer science and much more. Nothing to do with web development or HTML or for loops in Python, which is what every club or event seemed to be promoting. And how computer science could be integrated into other fields like public policy, healthcare, climate change, and more. \nDespite my annoyances, I helped put on StarHacks I and II. I increased registration from 800 to 1200 (I to II) and our speakers for SH I and II were amazing. I was proud of the event I helped build, but I still wanted to be part of the planning team, instead of someone in marketing.\nSince I was sure I had more hackathon experience, I applied for the logistics team at nwPlus. I did the interview and then was asked to interview for the marketing team instead. I was sad about not being able to get into logistics but I asked myself; was the role more important, or the overall impact you could have just being part of the club. I chose the latter and accepted the offer for marketing, but deep down I knew that the actual role was more important to me.\nI've been asked \"Why marketing\" and my response is something like: \"I think marketing is essential because it allows a group/company to share their values with individuals and expose individuals to a product or event that could change their lives, who would have never known without the outreach\". But I didn't really get to do that. What marketing really was, was copy-pasting captions into Instagram, clicking posts, and then spamming other clubs to share your post. Absolutely mundane work.\nBeing the external eyes and look of something also means you interact with other groups trying to do the same thing as you. And it just feels so artificial now. Everyone wants you to share their opportunity. Everyone is making their iteration of the same idea. But why??? I don't think most groups create events or opportunities with intention. Most workshops are copies of each other, and topics are generic, random, and poorly executed in some cases. Additionally, I hate the \"girlification\" of things like \"girlboss\" \"stemist\". Not only does it separate women further than their male peers, but what does \"girlboss\" or \"stemnist\" even mean? what do these words imply? There's no word like \"boyboss\" or \"stemboys\" because it sounds ridiculous. This is why I cared much more about the role I would be involved in. I was essentially sometimes marketing events I wasn't personally aligned with. And then comes the overworking.\nBeing a Giver\nAnyways, I also have a fear, or more like the feeling I need to give it my all. I believe that when I say something I better do it and I better do it as best as I can, and I get scared if I don't do something then people will dislike me for it. This is probably what has crippled me the most. But not everyone feels that way. I believe that if I give as much care and work into something, others will too. But that's so wrong, and a truth I need to learn. Sometimes if you're lucky, a team does mirror your efforts. I think the StarHacks team does this. But that is rare and in most extracurriculars, it's been me doing a lot of the work; either unasked of or because other team members simply didn't. At nwPlus, I had to become the unofficial Director for a few weeks because the actual Marketing Director just didn't do anything. It wasn't something I wanted to do, but my fear of being seen as lazy pushed me into doing the role of Director and eventually becoming a Co-Director, a role I just felt like I had to take because I'm scared of disappointing people.\nThis behavior probably came from school group work where I felt like I was forced to do everything, and that same mindset is also present in other group work scenarios. As a \"gifted\" student in a predominantly white school, teachers would ask me to help other students, put me in groups with underperforming students, and the like. This has resulted in me responding to every slack message no matter what else I was doing (workout, class, literally anything) spending hours doing something that wasn't even assigned to me, pestering others to do their work, usually it was me doing it anyways. Every time I did the work that was supposed to be assigned to someone else, I would get \"sorries\" and \"thank yous\". But were they sincere? If they were, then I wouldn't always be the one picking up the slack. It wouldn't be a common occurrence. What's missing from that apology or thank you note is \"sorry/thank you for doing my work, I thought my time was more important than yours, and I trusted that you would just pick up the work.\". When you continually let your work fall on others, that's what you're saying to them.\nI, unfortunately, was giving too much of my time, and suffered mentally and physically; I eventually broke down after StarHacks II. I had just wasted two weekends glued to my laptop either marketing an event in real-time or moderating on Discord and Zoom. I faced abuse from some hackers and to add on I:\n\nbroke down both in front of the StarHacks team and then with my bf\nhad to drop three courses I wanted to take; I had 5 courses planned out for my second term, and I'm now only doing three because of how behind I was in my other courses.\ngot an eye infection\nfucked up my organic chemistry midterm which was 2 days after the hackathon\n\nAll of this could have been prevented, had I not been involved in extracurriculars that forced me to give up my time because I couldn't depend on others.\nWas I good at marketing? Who knows, I sure as hell don't. Do I like marketing? Hell no. Then why I was still doing it?\nThis breakdown has caused me to reevaluate the way I spend my time and why I spend it that way. Why am I even in marketing at nwPlus if I disliked it so much? Why did I keep giving my time to others when I was flailing around myself? Why did I continue to help put on hackathons when I didn't even like them myself?\nI'm planning to leave all hackathon-related activities eventually. As to not disrupt the team (which happened to the marketing team at nwPlus, when our Director led our team to a pretty bad marketing run for HackCamp, and then left), I'm going to leave when the hackathon season ends. It's not fair to others who are working hard and care about nwPlus for me to leave abruptly like a former teammate did, because there are some amazing and passionate people at nwPlus who have helped me so much when I was trying to take on the role of Director (and for that, thank you, y'all should know who you are). I'm writing this out to hold myself accountable.\nI do still want to help people, but only how I want to. I like helping people in a way that benefits me too. There are two ways:\n\nTAing\ninformal coffee chats\n\nTAing\nI enjoy TAing because I can interact with other students and help from breakthrough problems they are having with course content. I've also formed a mentor-mentee type relationship with some students who also ask about upper-year courses, co-op, internships, or computer science in general. It's also nice to talk to other TAs, who want to TA for the same reasons that you are TAing. \nInformal Coffee Chats\nSometimes students in high school or students I've TAed at UBC message me on Linkedin and I'm always happy to send a chat message to them. It's nice because they took the time out of their day to approach you and usually in writing they think of concise questions to ask. \nGaining my time back\nI've deleted slack off all my devices except my laptop. I only check within a certain time and then get back to work. I think more before signing up for volunteer roles; do I want to do this? And lastly, I'm taking more time for myself to learn freely by attending panels, reading random stuff, or just relaxing. I watch more animal YouTube videos nowadays or I just lay in bed thinking. \nUpdates: typos\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/life/leaving-extrac/","title":"Why I'm done organizing hackathons"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/life/money-molecules-third-year/":{"body":"After three years in university, I finally came to my senses and changed my major to a combined major in Computer Science and Chemistry. But why has it taken three years? And why did I have so much difficulty in just changing my major to include chemistry?\nLots of students change their majors. But chemistry wasn't just \"chemistry\". It was the subject area that I, and my dad, am and still is passionate about. The difference is that my didn't get to pursue his dreams and passions. He had to pivot to the software industry, which was booming at the time I was about to be born. His dreams and passions could not support his family. So in a way, it feels almost wrong, for me, his daughter, to pursue her dreams and passions, which were so similar to his. I struggled with these thoughts a lot. So what did I do? I tried out everything but chemistry. I did courses in biology, microbiology and biochemistry. But none of them clicked. Every my biology, microbiology or biochemistry professor mentioned something about chemistry in relation to a lecture topic I was so excited. But it would only be for a few minutes. I soon realised that the parts of courses I liked the most were the parts in which the professor made some connection to chemistry. \nSomething from my chemistry professor Dr. Perrin that I think a lot about:\n\nI opted to make molecules because if I ever gave that up, I could always make money whereas if I chose the money option, I would never have a chance to make a molecule.\n\nI'm still unsure of what I want to do in the future.

RNA is just a set of instructions telling the cell how to make proteins. This is very similar to computer viruses; computer viruses try to run their code either alongside the \"good\" code or also try to block the execution of the \"good\" code. Code is also a set of instructions telling the computer what to do. \nSecondly, a difference, is that I don't think computer viruses can evolve or mutate (?), probably because computers are not prone to making mistakes and there isn't a need to change a working computer virus. Something like a polymorphic virus seems like a mutating virus, but its function doesn't change. On the other hand, translating RNA is more error-prone than translating DNA, and virions are competing for resources and have to assemble properly before being released, so they are prone to chemistry, physics, and biology at that moment in time. So you could get a different virus strain upon releasing the new virions, though that new strain is not always more infectious. \nAnother thing that's interesting is how viruses can rearrange parts of your cell. HCV creates membranous webs, completely rearranging your ER to its liking. Kinda like corrupting the memory of your computer. \nIt's quite interesting how a piece of code or piece of RNA could cause so much damage. \n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/lifesci/computer-bio-virus/","title":"💻 Computers Viruses and Biological Viruses"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/lifesci/cs-bchem/":{"body":"My choice to major in biochemistry and computer science is unconventional. Even though there aren't many common courses between the two disciplines (except MATH 100/101/200 😢), I wouldn't have my major any other way.   Since the seventh grade, I became obsessed with chemistry. For fun, I drew out my periodic table and hung it on the wall in my room. That periodic table still hangs in my room. But how did I get started in computer science? \na sad start\nIn high school, I joined the robotics team on a whim. When I learned that you had to use C++ to program the robot, I dropped out of the robotics team. I went back to my safe space - chemistry - and planned to major in chemistry. I've always been interested in chemistry at a young age; chemistry tinted the way I saw the world. Finding out that my eczema cream had steroids and how damaging steroids were, was because of chemistry. And reading about anammox bacteria (bacteria that oxidizes ammonium to dinitrogen gas using nitrite as the electron acceptor, source) fascinated me. \na harsh reality\nBut after I told my father I wanted to major in chemistry, he urged me to reconsider; the job market for chemistry graduates was slim. Since he was a software engineer, I decided that I'd try to pursue a computer science degree, a subject I had no prior knowledge of (except a glimpse of C++ from robotics). And that's how my journey in CS began.\nlost\nGoing into computer science, I felt like I didn't know what I didn't know. Thus, I felt very lost in my first year as a computer science major. And unfortunately, my exposure to computer science in high school was disappointing. I never saw computer science as anything interesting, and all the semi-colons and brackets scared me. At the time, programming didn't provide the stimulus that I felt when I drew out complicated organic chemistry structures or solved thermodynamic equations.\nbiochemistry x computer science\nFortunately, my love of chemistry helped me solidify my choice to stay in computer science. I came across Open Chemistry on GitHub and was deeply intrigued. Eventually, I learned about other intersections of healthcare and technology from DeepMind's AlphaFold to virtual doctor visits; I saw how the intersection of computer science and healthcare could help society. Something I've never realized until now is that computer science could push society forward, but not on its own; it must require knowledge from many disciplines. Since I'm passionate about chemistry and healthcare,  I'm now majoring in computer science and minoring in biochemistry. \nnow\nCurrently, I'm a software developer intern at a biotechnology not-for-profit organization. In my role, I'm building a pipeline to automate the extraction of patient information from surgery reports. This position gives me a lot of pride because I believe my actions could one day contribute to a better surgeon experience and better patient experience.\nI want young women (or anyone) to know pursuing computer science does not mean it's all or nothing. I encourage everyone to combine computer science with their other passions. Computer science reaches its potential when combined with other fields. I also want young women to know it's never too late to start in CS. It's never too late to learn.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/lifesci/cs-bchem/","title":"🧬 Why Biochemistry and Computer Science?"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/lifesci/digital-contact-tracing/":{"body":"I welcome thoughts and critique on this post. Contact me via Twitter or email.\nNeed to add proper citations. A work in progress.\nTL;DR: \nProximity and time based exposure notifications works when viruses were thought to be spread through respiratory droplets that quickly dropped to the ground and were rarely or never even thought to be airborne. This would mean after 15 mins or if you were two meters from someone you could assume almost or no viral load was transferred to you, and thus no exposure risk. \nNow that we know COVID-19 is airborne and can linger in the air for minutes to hours and travel farther than 2 meters, other factors, like the infected’s quality of mask, air filtration and air circulation quality better, more accurately determine how far the virus can travel, how long the virus lingers in the air, which determines the viral load which then determines whether or not someone could have been exposed.\nA paper that suggested the idea of digital contact tracing made these reasons as to why a digital contact tracing app could be a tool to reduce infections during the COVID-19 pandemic:\n\nmanual contact tracing is too slow to bring down the R value, but a digital contact tracing app that instantaneously notified a exposed person to isolate would bring down the R value.\n\n\"There is no delay between case confirmation and notification of contacts; thus, the delay for the contact quarantine process is the period from an individual experiencing symptoms to their contacts entering quarantine. The delay between symptom development and case confirmation will decrease with faster testing protocols, and indeed could become instant if presumptive diagnosis of COVID-19 based on symptoms were accepted in high-prevalence areas.\"\n\n\n\"If testing capacity is limited, individuals who are identified by tracing may be presumed confirmed upon onset of symptoms, because the prior probability of them being positive is higher than for the index case, accelerating the algorithm further without compromising specificity.\"\n\"With fast enough testing, even index cases diagnosed late in infection could be traced recursively to identify\nrecently infected individuals, both before they develop symptoms and before they transmit.\" \n\nThis could be done quickly with an algorithm, as opposed to manual contact tracing.\n\n\n\"Because time of infection is generally not known, the generation time is often approximated by the serial interval, which is defined as the time between the onset of symptoms of the source and the onset of symptoms of the recipient.\"\ndigital contact tracing apps have had success in China and South Korea.\n\"The app can serve as the central hub of access to all COVID-19 health services, information, and instructions, and as a mechanism to request food or medicine deliveries during self-isolation\"\n\nIn fact, Canada has their own digital contact tracing app. It works as shown below: \n\n\nWhen you're near someone else with the app, both phones exchange random codes every 5 minutes.\nThe app estimates how close app users are to one another by the strength of their Bluetooth signals.\nThe random codes change often and can’t be used to identify you.\nAn exposure is recorded if you’re within 2 metres of someone with COVID-19 for 15 minutes or longer.\nEach day, your phone gets a list of the random codes of app users who have reported a diagnosis. This is only possible when connected to the internet.\nIf it finds a matching code on your phone, the app notifies you that you've been exposed. It explains what to do next.\n\nThe general idea around digital contact tracing apps is that based on some proximity and time threshold, in Canada's COVID-19 app this is 2 metres and 15 minutes, you will be alerted with a notification that you were exposed to someone with COVID-19. Upon this notification, you would quarantine to prevent infecting other people. It's been a year since the release of Canada's digital tracking app, and I took a peek at the report. \nMaybe you're wondering why I'm so interested in this. Well, digital contact tracing sounded like a super cool idea of an application of technology in public health. I was excited for the app and downloaded it myself. Unfortunately, I've deleted it, and in my review of the report maybe you'll see why.\nMy review of the \"Interim report on social and economic determinants of app adoption, retention and use\"\nThe Canadian government came out with a report, Interim report on social and economic determinants of app adoption, retention and use, reviewing how the app has done during the pandemic. Here are my thoughts (in italic). When I say \"council\" I mean \"COVID-19 Exposure Notification App Advisory Council\".\n\nCOVID Alert has been downloaded over 6 million times, and 20,000 people have since entered a one-time key (OTK) following a positive COVID-19 test result, notifying other users that they may have been exposed to the virus.\n\nAs of Feb 2022, there have been 6,893,423 downloads and 57,704 keys used. With a population of around 38 millions, this means only 15-20% of the population has downloaded the app. There are apparently 3.64M tracked COVID-19 cases (all time) in Canada when I checked on Apr 18. This means the app had access to around 1.6% of positive cases to determine if someone could have been exposed, and then alert them. Such a low number of reported cases means this app is a inaccurate tool for someone to use as a judgement to whether they have been exposed or not.\n\nCOVID Alert is a national exposure notification app that will alert users if they have been in close contact with other users who have tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nGetting only reports for \"close contact\" gives the impression that you can only get sick from being \"close\" to someone. This is incorrect, since researchers have discovered cases in which no one was a close contact with each other, yet still people were becoming infected. You can get sick without being near someone who is sick.\n\nAlthough individuals experiencing these barriers  are unable to use the app directly, they can still benefit from it if other people use it. For example, if someone with the app receives a notification, they may decide not to visit a medically vulnerable person. This action protects the vulnerable person from potential exposure, even if the vulnerable person does not have their own compatible phone.\n\nMuch of the app is based on voluntary action. \"may decide\" is used, and this makes it seem as if vulnerable people are at the mercy of those who have the latest technology and can use the digital contact tracing app. We can't assume people will act with the best intentions, and certainly cannot just leave vulnerable folks at the hands of able bodied and privileged people. The report also implies that it's okay to exclude vulnerable from this tool. Everyone deserves access to data and information to protect themselves.\n\nCurrently, British Columbia, Alberta, Nunavut and the Yukon have not adopted the COVID Alert app.\n\nIf nearly all of Western Canada isn't able to use the app, then that's a huge piece of data missing.\n\nEarly notification is key to the success of the COVID Alert app in breaking the chain of infection by encouraging self-isolation until direction from public heath authorities can be sought. ... To date, more than 80% of users who receive an OTK enter it into the app; however, fewer than 5% of positive cases have obtained an OTK from their public health authority. \n\nAgain, lets assume those who get an key self isolate. That's less than 5% of positive cases self isolating. Public health requires the entire public to participate. 5% participating is simply too low. \nThe report outlines reasons that users uninstall the app: \n\nPerceives that the app is not user-friendly;\nBelieves that the app will not be substantially effective without broader public uptake;\n\nI believe this as well, and this statement is why I uninstalled the app. Digital contact tracing can provide some insight if most of the population uses it, much like in China, South Korea or Taiwan. With less than 5% of positive cases entering a key and only 18% of the population having downloaded the app (not sure how many actually use it), the data is just random noise.\n\n\nDoes not receive any exposure notifications and therefore assumes that the app is not performing as designed;\n\nObviously this is because there's literally such low numbers of data being collected, which gives people the impression that COVID-19 isn't transmitting around that munch, which is totally incorrect. The app simply can't reflect the true transmission rates because not enough data is being entered.\n\n\nLacks understanding or is confused by on how the app works (e.g., contact-based and not location-based);\nExperiences anxiety related to receiving a notification and possible consequences (e.g., isolating, testing); or\n\nif you were to receive a diagnosis, you would probably prefer a human tell you, rather than an app. With an app, there's no one to help you answer follow up questions or to calm you down. This is why we need humans.\n\n\nExperiences technical issues such as battery life on some phone models.\n\nbluetooth is incredibly battery draining.\n\n\n\nHere are some new features they've added:\n\nnarrowing the exposure notification window to periods when a COVID-positive user was the most infectious, by allowing the user to voluntarily enter their symptom onset or test date;\n\nthis is horrible. There are cases when people who are asymptomatic are infectious. Additionally, with all the COVID-19 variants, someone becomes infectious at different rates. We can't simplify down COVID-19 to just when we think someone is most infectious. This also seems very hard to determine, because of how variants aren't turning up as positive on rapid tests and the lack of tests in the first place.\n\n\nallowing users, specifically for health care workers, to manually turn the app off when wearing the appropriate personal protective equipment in areas with high likelihood of being near COVID-positive persons (e.g. test centres, long-term care facilities); and\n\nthis makes some sense, but further research would need to be done.\n\n\nallowing users to clear the exposed state following a negative test result, in order to permit users to receive new exposure notifications.\n\nguidance must be given on this. Since rapid tests aren't always accurate, someone may take a false negative as being no longer infected, when in fact they are still contagious.\n\n\n\nThese points oversimplify COVID-19 to just \"avoiding\" someone when they are most infectious, and encouraging people to prematurely return back to society when they may still be infectious. Transmission can occur when you're not even beside an infected individual. The virus can linger in the air. Nothing about letting users know about CO2 levels or air transmission is mentioned.\nUnder \"Strategies to reduce barriers and increase adoption, retention and proper use of the app\":\n\nEstablish a baseline number of app downloads that would be considered sufficient to appropriately measure the effectiveness of the app in reducing the spread of the virus;\n\nThe council acknowledges that WHO said in 2020 that \"no established methods for assessing the effectiveness of digital proximity tracking\" but then goes on to say that \"The Scientific Director of the Big Data Institute at the University of Oxford recently indicated that apps such as COVID Alert are having a positive impact, even in the absence of specific quantifying metrics and that the concept of a minimal adoption rate is less relevant to these apps because this type of tool is effective regardless of its level of up-take\". I'm not sure if I believe this.\n\nThe Government of Canada has begun to broadly consider how the COVID Alert app could potentially extend beyond a government service to Canadians and the public health system towards a tool that will also support Canadians and businesses in our economic, social and mental health recovery and restoration. To this end, it will be critical for individuals and businesses in Canada to have trust in the app's ability to support their safe return to worksites and universities, their reopening of businesses, and their use of modes of transportation including public transit (air, marine, and rail services) until the pandemic is declared over. The advice of the Council will help to inform the Government's next steps in all of these regards.\n\nThe statement above directly contradicts with the statement that the Canadian government will work on \"eventual wind-down of the app, including recommendations for the timely destruction of data.\"\n\nPosition COVID Alert as one additional tool at the disposal of Canadians, to better situate its position within the broader public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic and to highlight success stories that would resonate with Canadians; ... This will be critical in achieving wider uptake, which will involve clear communications, ongoing engagement with diverse partners and communities; and continuous improvements to the app (e.g. new functionalities and emerging technologies that could help to re-open parts of the economy)\n\nThis frustrates me. We have tools that work and do reduce cases. High quality masks, air filtration and circulation and UV. I'm disappointed that none of these were mentioned. We don't need more tools, (and most certainly we don't need more apps). Instead, we need to use tools that work.\n\nThrough the deployment of the COVID Alert app, the Government of Canada has committed to deploying a technology-based solution that will assist Canada in flattening the curve and limiting the spread of COVID-19. \n\nThe public has to trust health experts and actively prevent infection by masking up, getting routinely tested for COVID-19, self isolating if symptomatic. Government needs to track data, such as waste water and CO2 levels so we can preaper for the futrue adn decrease transmission of the virus through the air. We shouldn't be investing so much time and energy into a tool we aren't even sure works when we now understand that COVID-19 is airborne.\nTechnology based solutions frequently simplify complex solutions into simple models that may not be accurate. It's been two years since the pandemic began and we have more knowledge of the virus. There are tools that do work, such as CO2 monitors, which can help someone decide if eating at a restaurant is safe or not. Digital contact tracing, at it's current state, does not provide any useful information to citizens. There are no metrics mentioned, after more than one year of use, if this app prevented anyone from being infected. We can't say the app has assisted at all in limiting spread of COVID-19 if there's no metrics to back that up.\nThe report fails to mention anything about COVID-19 being airborne and what the app plans to change to take into account that distances more than 2m may still expose someone to COVID-19. \nWith more variants emerging, the government has a responsibility to update it's citizens about these variants and provide data to help citizens make informed decisions.\nOur world is constantly changing, and software must adapt to these changes, not the other way around. However, it seems today that the world is constantly catering to the software, simplifying down complex situations only to have the world slap us in the face later.\n\nSince it's been almost two (or three) years since the pandemic started, we know more about how the COVID-19 virus infects and transmits. I want to first say that based on how Western societies treated about viruses (not really airborne, washing hands and social distancing should be enough) and the fear around saying COVID-19 transmitted via the air, our response was understandable. But it's been a year since, and digital contact tracing apps haven't really demonstrated a contribution to reducing infection. Here are the reasons I want to highlight on why I think it there's a low chance of Canada being able to adopt a digital contact tracing app and why I think the digital contact tracing app is inaccurate:\n\nIs proximity the best measure? \nTesting and variants\nAdoption of the app by the public\n\nIs proximity the best measure?\nThe paper I mentioned above also stated that: \n\nBy devoting considerable resources, including police investigation, 75 of the 92 cases of local transmission were traced back to their presumed exposure, either to a known case or to a location linked to spread (15). Linking cases via a location generally includes the possibility of environmentally mediated transmission. Therefore, the large fraction of traceable transmission in Singapore does not contradict the large fraction without symptomatic exposure in Wuhan.\n\nIt's understandable that we assumed COVID-19 wasn't airborne, as other deadly illnesses like cholera and polio spread through fluids and fecal matter. Declaring a virus is airborne is also alarming, and as a global body, WHO may have thought it was their responsibility not to accidentally set a false alarm. However, we now know that COVID-19 is airborne. \nDigital contract tracing apps which use proximity to determine exposure reduce COVID-19 transmission into the notion that we only need to be near sick people to get sick. When not much was known about COVID-19 transmission and it was believed to transmit through respiratory droplets that quickly fell to the ground, this would of been a model that made sense. But with more research highlighting evidence on COVID-19 transmission occurring when people aren't near each other and that particles of up to 100 microns can stay in the air, proximity isn't a good measure for exposure anymore and downplays how transmissible COVID-19 is. Canada's digital contact tracing app uses 2 m as a proximity measure, but you can be infected from distances much farther and many factors play into what distance is \"safe\".\nFrom What is the evidence to support the 2-metre social distancing rule to reduce COVID-19 transmission?\n:\n\nA one-size-fits-all 2-metre social distancing rule is not consistent with the underlying science of exhalations and indoor air. Such rules are based on an over-simplistic picture of viral transfer, which assume a clear dichotomy between large droplets and small airborne droplets emitted in isolation without accounting for the exhaled air. The reality involves a continuum of droplet sizes and an important role of the exhaled air that carries them.\nSmaller airborne droplets laden with SARS-CoV-2 may spread up to 8 metres concentrated in exhaled air from infected individuals, even without background ventilation or airflow. Whilst there is limited direct evidence that live SARS-CoV-2 is significantly spread via this route, there is no direct evidence that it is not spread this way.\n\nWith surface spreading viruses or fluid (liquid) spreading viruses, we don't need to be near someone to get sick. People can get infected with cholera by using water from a stream that could by miles away from the infected person. We need to be in contact with that surface or fluid to get sick. It doesn't matter if that person is close or not, though that person being close can increase the risk of us getting sick, it's not the main determining factor. In fact, there are several cases of COVID-19 transmission between people who have never seen each other, but have breathed the same air via air conditioning.\nWe get sick by interacting with the virus via contaminated air, not just by being near an infected person.\nIn virology lecture we are taught that airborne particles can be respiratory droplets or aerosolised particles. Respiratory droplets eventually fall to the ground, while aerosolized particles can linger in the air. \nAt the beginning of the pandemic, WHO made the erroneous judgement that COVID-19 was spread through respiratory droplets that eventually fall onto surfaces and then infect those that touch those surfaces. This mistake led Western nations to slap a sanitizer machine at every building entrance, increase their sanitization of desks and more surface focused cleaning. On the contrary, many Asian countries have ignored WHO, acting on research that is paints COVID-19 as a much more infectious virus than WHO and Western nations think. And it seems to have paid off. \nWhy did WHO decide that COVID-19 wasn't airborne? Well, since transmission was thought to occur through sneezes, coughs, etc, that expel large respiratory droplets, WHO thought that these respiratory droplets would just fall to the ground. Lot's of medical experts were making the assumption that most viruses weren't airborne since particles were bigger than 5 microns.. My virology lecture may have not be totally correct as well, because maybe respiratory droplets do stay in the air longer than we thought. \nThere's a history that may have been a reason why WHO acted the way they did.\n\nIn 1934, Wells and his wife, Mildred Weeks Wells, a physician, analyzed air samples and plotted a curve showing how the opposing forces of gravity and evaporation acted on respiratory particles. The couple’s calculations made it possible to predict the time it would take a particle of a given size to travel from someone’s mouth to the ground. According to them, particles bigger than 100 microns sank within seconds. Smaller particles stayed in the air. Randall paused at the curve they’d drawn. To her, it seemed to foreshadow the idea of a droplet-aerosol dichotomy, but one that should have pivoted around 100 microns, not 5. \n\nSo what happened? Why haven't we been using the 100 micron metric? Well, \n\nPart of medical rhetoric is understanding why certain ideas take hold and others don’t. So as spring turned to summer, Randall started to investigate how Wells’ contemporaries perceived him. That’s how she found the writings of Alexander Langmuir, the influential chief epidemiologist of the newly established CDC. Like his peers, Langmuir had been brought up in the Gospel of Personal Cleanliness, an obsession that made handwashing the bedrock of US public health policy. He seemed to view Wells’ ideas about airborne transmission as retrograde, seeing in them a slide back toward an ancient, irrational terror of bad air—the “miasma theory” that had prevailed for centuries. Langmuir dismissed them as little more than “interesting theoretical points.”\n\nAnd then after Langmuir disparaged Well's work he came up with this:\n\nIn the report, Langmuir cited a few studies from the 1940s looking at the health hazards of working in mines and factories, which showed the mucus of the nose and throat to be exceptionally good at filtering out particles bigger than 5 microns. The smaller ones, however, could slip deep into the lungs and cause irreversible damage. If someone wanted to turn a rare and nasty pathogen into a potent agent of mass infection, Langmuir wrote, the thing to do would be to formulate it into a liquid that could be aerosolized into particles smaller than 5 microns, small enough to bypass the body’s main defenses. Curious indeed. Randall made a note.\n\nLangmuir did eventually shift his tone and accept that airborne infection was possible. After Well's died, Langmuir delivered a speech stating \"problematic particles—the ones they had to worry about—were smaller than 5 microns.\" And that screwup started it all. However, particles that are up to 100 microns are also airborne!\nWhile most viruses are 0.1 to 0.5 microns, viruses hitch a ride on the droplets that we produce when breathing, sneezing or coughing. From this study there are droplets that measure at below or around 100 microns. This means someone's sneeze can travel around a room. \n\nOkay, that was a lot of preamble. I wanted to set up why the virus being airborne is important and how digital contact tracing misses on this. Digital contact tracing apps seems like a fun algorithmic problem to determine who's been near who! Which is just another complex public health and social problem reduced into a algorithm. It seems perfect. In fact, I was exited for Canada to get their own contact tracing app after seeing some success in countries like South Korea and Taiwan. \nBut the app is missing a lot of context. For one, depending on whether or no the air is actively being filtered, being 6 ft (or 2m) may be enough distance, or it might not be. And depending on one's mask, this further complicates what distance is \"safe\" from being exposed to infection, The app simply doesn't know, and giving erroneous information is worse than no information. The app doesn't know anything about the quality of the air. Distance doesn't matter so much if the air is being constantly filtered. A CO2 monitor would be more helpful than an app that tells me if I've been near a sick person. Basically, the app totally simplifies and neglects how air transmission works. The only way you can tell if you've been exposed is if you have a CO2 monitor telling you if air is being filtered and circulated around enough such that you aren't breathing in the air other people exhale.\nSince COVID-19 virus is airborne, one should assume no distance is safe, unless they had data to tell them otherwise. For instance, It would be useful to know if I was in a restaurant or building that had bad air quality. Much of the public has no access to knowledge of whether their air is being filtered or not, or the quality of the filter. If we aren't able to access high quality, real time data on positive cases, understanding our air quality is the next best piece of data we can use to make informed choices. \nAs Ali Alkhatib says in his blog post \"We Need to Talk About Digital Contact Tracing\", \n\nDigital contact tracing systems that render the world as normally distributed space with spheres of influence and contact characterized by radio waves will consistently leave us with dangerously wrong pictures of our exposure.\n\nI've mostly been discussing science, but please check out his blog post to learn how digital contact tracing excludes the most vulnerable, gathers unrepresentative data, how proximal tracing doesn't maintain privacy and how proximity is a dangerously simple way to model and think about COVID-19 transmission. \nTo get infected, viruses require affinity and avidity with the human receptor.\nThere's a lot of chemistry, physics and biology involved in getting infected. First, the physics of viruses. Viruses spread through surface, liquid and air. The physics for each medium is different and it's important we all have some basic understanding of how to prevent transmission given the medium of spread. If transmission occurs by:\n\nsurface: sanitize, wash your hands and don't shake hands.\nliquids: boil drinking water, don't drink suspicious liquids be vary of who you share fluids with.\nair: filter the air and wear a N95 mask when air filtration isn't possible or when you must interact with people.\n\nBut preventing transmission isn't always possible. To become infected, viruses require affinity and avidity. What does this mean? Well it's time for chemistry. Affinity is how strongly two molecules will react with each other. We can think of this as the binding event between the virus and human receptor. The stronger the binding event, the better. More specifically if the virus has more affinity to bind than the native molecule that usually binds to the human receptor, then the virus is on it's first step to infecting us. Next, we must have avidity, which is the accumulated strength of multiple affinities. Affinity isn't always enough, thus, if there's more virus than native molecule, the higher concentration of virus can out compete the native molecule. Once some threshold is met, you are infected. \n\nFigure is from this paper\nAnd the biology is how our body responds. Our immune systems will respond first, however infection can involve other organs, such as our lungs.\nOkay, so what does this mean? There are some things we can't control, like how a virus spreads or which human receptor the virus will bind to and how strongly that virus will bind. But there are some things we can control, like avidity and our immune response. We can control our avidity to a virus by wearing high quality masks and requesting better air filtration. We can control our immune response by getting vaccines.\nUnfortunately, education on proper masks has been non existent, with some health leaders suggesting that cloth masks are still okay to wear (they aren't). \n\nContact tracing apps make it easy to forget the physics, chemistry and biology of viruses. These apps boil viruses down to exposure time and proximity to infected individuals. Many important factors like the method of spread, avidity and immune response are pushed to the sidelines with software solutions, with millions of dollars going into these apps.\nTesting and Variants\nTesting\nThe Canada digital tracking app requires a one time key to use if you have a confirmed positive case of COVID-19. I would assume this means those who don't have access to tests wouldn't be able to self report their positive case or if they were feeling symptoms (I'm not sure).\nThis goes against the advice that the paper gives:\n\n\"If testing capacity is limited, individuals who are identified by tracing may be presumed confirmed upon onset of symptoms, because the prior probability of them being positive is higher than for the index case, accelerating the algorithm further without compromising specificity.\"\n\nMuch of the success of the app relies on quickly and accurately detecting positive cases with testing. However with variants that aren't always showing up on rapid tests, the delay of results with PCR tests, inaccessibility and economic barriers to testing, this severely limits who gets tested. \nUntil we have faster, more accurate, more accessible and cheaper tests, the accuracy of digital tracking apps will be pretty low. \nthink about this deprecation with the current state of testing availability/eligibility. and you can still download the app? tell me i’m missing something someone please https://t.co/ueA49gUtVJ— Bianca Wylie (@biancawylie) April 15, 2022 \nAs of now, there seems to be no way to report a self test.\nis there a way to report our cases to ontario gov? I cannot find anything anywhere to report to so cases of my family will be counted. https://t.co/bLSiImovma— Amanjeev 𒄇 (@amanjeev) April 15, 2022 \nThe main goal of the digital tracking app is to notify and allow someone to self isolate before they even begin showing symptoms or infecting others. Without access to tests, this makes it very hard to achieve this notion of instantaneous contact tracing. Days matter a lot when trying to prevent the spreading of COVID-19.\n\nViruses mutate at random. A lot.\nBut viruses don't mutate everywhere at random. We've observed with COVID-19 variants and other coronaviruses that there are some conserved regions that undergo mutation a lot less. For instance, the residues of the substrate-binding pocket of the substrate-binding pocket are highly conserved and don't really undergo much mutation, since this protein is essential to replication and proteolytic processing.\nBut the spike protein on the other hand goes through a lot of mutation. For instance, many Omicron's mutations are associated with the ACE2 receptor binding and antibody binding sites (our vaccines currently target these proteins). \nMutations are random, but those random mutations that can survive current drugs and vaccines are the viruses that will continue to spread. Mutations that occur on proteins like the main protease may also occur, but some mutations are more deadly to the virus than others, and these mutated viruses simply cease to replicate, ending their ability to spread.\nWith that being said, for current drugs and vaccines to continue working, we have to slow down the chance for the virus mutate. The likelihood of mutation increases as more and more people become infected. This means we must prevent infection. \nPeople will argue that infection is mild, but getting infected isn't just about getting infected. It's about whether or not you become the new reservoir to the next COVID-19 variant.\nDigital contact tracing apps can give someone an over simplified model of how COVID-19 transmits; using proximity doesn't make much sense since the virus can stick around in the air and viral load is dependent on a lot factors like masking, air ventilation/filtration. The longer and more we get infected, the more variants there will be. It's time to ditch the app and go back to tracking data and using methods like masking and air filtration; methods that work.\nAdoption of the app by the public\nI was excited by the announcement of Canada's digital tracking app after hearing about the success in South Korea and China. However, as I highlighted above, I later uninstalled app because no one was using it. \nThe paper mentions some important points. Firstly, in China the app was a success because:\n\nPublic health policy was implemented using an app that was not compulsory but was required to move between quarters and into public spaces and public transport.\n\nObviously, that sort of adoption has not happened in Canada and probably will not. Only 15-20% of the Canada's population has installed the app. If we play with some simulations here and assume 20% of Canadians will self isolate, maybe assuming 20% of infections will be stopped, this is still not enough to move COVID-19 into endemic phase. This analysis done quite early during the pandemic which was based on early research and the less transmissible OG COVID-19 variant states we only need to stop 60% of infections.\n\nOther points the paper mentions, such as: \n\nSuccessful and appropriate use of the app relies on it commanding well-founded public trust and confidence.\n\nwhich is unlikely to occur in a Western society where people are more independent and less trusting of their governments.\nAlso claims such as: \n\nThe intention is not to impose the technology as a permanent change to society, but we believe that under these pandemic circumstances it is necessary and justified to protect public health.\n\n\nIt is noteworthy that the algorithmic approach we propose avoids the need for coercive surveillance, because the system can have very large impacts and achieve sustained epidemic suppression even with partial uptake.\n\nare discussed in Ali Alkhatib's blog post. \nAll in all, I see a low chance for the app gaining a large enough adoption for the app to become a accurate tool to use as a means to decreasing infections.\nConclusion\nFor a digital contact tracing app to have some impact on reducing infections we need:\n\naccess to lots of quick and accurate tests\nan preventative mindset towards being exposed, as outlined in the paper: \"If testing capacity is limited, individuals who are identified by tracing may be presumed confirmed upon onset of symptoms, because the prior probability of them being positive is higher than for the index case.\"\nability for people to upload self confirmed tests to the app\nadoption of the app by 60%* of the population\npeople to actually self isolate until they are no longer sick\n\nBut I don't think it's worth the time and money to keep trying to use digital contact tracing apps at this stage. Using proximity as a measure of whether someone has been exposed oversimplifies our new understanding of how COVID-19 spreads and the science around COVID-19. \nHowever, to prevent new variants and prevent long covid I believe we must work towards no infections at all, not just reducing infections. I understand this is a more extreme stance, but drug and vaccine development simply will always lab behind the virus, and developing drugs and vaccines isn't easy! Since 100% adoption of the app isn't feasible, I don't think digital contact tracing works in a Western society. \nAlberta spent $4.3 million on their digital contact tracing app, which only notified 1,500 people of possible exposure.. We have tools that work and we know what works. Good quality masks, air filtration and circulation and UV.

When I was in my first year of university, everyone around me (computer science students) was buzzing about hackathons, so I thought I had to attend and like hackathons. \nHowever, the environment and atmosphere of hackathons were soon unappealing to me. Move fast and break things. Sit for 8 hours and eat junk food. Kiss up to companies. Hack together a prototype. These mantras were all against who I was: I liked to sit and think and stare, eat vegetables and move around, do projects slowly and little by little, and I never cared about working for a company before attending a hackathon. \nSo why keep going to hackathons and organizing them if hackathons didn't align with my work style, thought processes, and life goals?

If you want to see my involvement in hackathons, check out my LinkedIn.\nI don't know if I will continue to speak at hackathons because many hackathons don't align with my values anymore, so it wouldn't make sense for me to be active in hackathons, even as an external speaker.

Please don't plagiarize my essay.\n\nFrom a young age, humans are curious beings; the simple question of \"why\" is perhaps the question parents hear most from their toddlers. And when we got explanations to our \"why?\", we mostly assumed what a superior told us was “true”; correct and in accordance with. However, as I got older and learned more things, I realized not everything told to me was true (in fact, sometimes quite wrong). I wondered, if something untrue, was still beneficial to my advancement of knowledge. However, I have come to realise that good explanations - that allow for a majority of society to understand a concept, without the need for specialized knowledge - should not be judged on their validity in determining their value. In the Natural Sciences and Religious Knowledge Systems, explanations do not have to be 100% true to provide good and sometimes better explanations (than true explanations). Thus, to what extent do Natural Sciences and Religious Knowledge Systems have to be based on true explanations to be good? I believe to a certain extent that the validity, or trueness, of an explanation is important; however, whether it is true or not should not determine if an explanation is good, rather how the explanation benefits society, and sometimes, this occurs when explanations are not entirely true. \nScience\nThe Acid/Base Theory\n\nIn the Natural Sciences, there are many complex phenomenons that are quite difficult to actually understand. Thus, to what extent can imagination be used to understand and teach complex scientific phenomenon? Such an example of this occurred in in my Chemistry IBHL class. When I first learned about acids and bases in junior high, I was taught the Bronsted Lowry theory of acids and bases, and used my imagination to picture the acid giving off a hydrogen ion to the base. This imagination aided me throughout high school. However, I later learned about Lewis theory, which explains that the base gives off a pair of electrons to the acid; an almost 180 degree flip from the Bronsted Lowry theory! Although the Bronsted Lowry theory is not true, I still use the theory to this day in modeling acid/base behaviours; for instance, in my biochemistry class we model amino acids with or without hydrogen atoms based on the pH. In our modern age, the world continually progresses; thus, knowledge in every discipline continually evolves, with Natural Sciences at the forefront of this everyday change. However, the discoveries that scientists make usually requires a great deal of knowledge to understand, knowledge much of society does not have the time or privilege to possess. Thus, through imagination, explanations in science can still be good, without being true. And often, these basic, but not entirely true explanations, serve their purpose in regular life. Complexity is not necessary everywhere in life, and sometimes, a general understanding of certain topics is all that is needed. \nThe Atomic Model\n\nA counterclaim I will now examine centers around the theories of the model of the atom. When I first learned Dalton’s billiard ball model in grade 10, it was quite easy to see that this model was wrong. Then I learned Bohr's model. Simply put, it describes electrons orbiting around a central positively charged center. I've probably drawn hundreds of these Bohr models for the first three rows of elements in the periodic table. However, in my chemistry HL class, I learned about the quantum mechanical model of the atom: this theory states that there is an electron cloud surrounding a positively charged nucleus, with some areas having a higher density of electrons. Electrons move in random motion, none of that orbit stuff. Did that mean I didn't even need to draw all those Bohr models? After learning about various atomic models, one may argue how close we can get to the “most true” answer is the whole purpose of science, and that a wrong explanation is simply useless to society because it contains a fallacy, seen clearly with the inaccuracies of the Dalton and Bohr model. Thus, these \"outdated\" theories should no longer be taught. However, providing complex explanations, such as the Schrödinger’s quantum model, which some may find hard to understand, is not always the best way to explain something. To visually understand that Boron has 5 electrons, should we explain the quantum mechanical model to someone in junior high? Does it add value to the 10th grader's understanding to tell them that the first two electrons are in 1s, the second two electrons are in 2s, and the last electron is in 2p? Or does the Bohr model suffice? Only a few individuals possess the knowledge to understand such theories: these “true” theories that are full of complicated mathematics. This would destroy the whole purpose of scientific exploration because if people do not embrace new discoveries, hard work goes to waste; the Bohr model, can provides a good explanation for someone who does not need to understand why an electron in 2s behaves differently in 3s in their everyday life. Thus, in the case of Natural Sciences, I believe that good explanations do not always have to be true. In fact, they may contain errors, yet still serve the purpose of providing scientific knowledge to everyone in society. \nReligon\nAnother Area of Knowledge I will examine is Religious Knowledge Systems. Religion is mostly based on explanations from texts and oral teachings, such as the Holy Bible in Christianity. I myself have been educated in a Western Catholic school system which regards the Bible as a historical text. However in the Bible, there are many fantastical events that simply would require magic (or something like that) to occur in today’s society. Thus, to what extent can reasoning dispute that religious explanations have to be true to be good?  Although some biblical stories are realistic, some stories contain  inconsistencies. Many of us would use our knowledge, and reason that if the creation story were true, that all of the world's population would be born by incest, because God only put two individuals on earth. Thus, in the case of religion, reasoning invites the idea that true explanations are not necessarily the best. By viewing the Bible as an allegory or a metaphor, rather than a historical text, we can all draw deeper meaning from its content. More of society can relate to the Bible, such as those who are scientific thinkers. For instance, the creation story now draws a different meaning. The seven days are symbolic of the long process, rather than a mere week. The presence of only Adam and Eve is symbolic of the idea that we humans are all related to each other by our feelings, our desires for happiness, and more. Therefore, in such a text-based Area of Knowledge that is usually heavily based on being true, sometimes, true explanations are not the best for explaining the unknowns of life. Through metaphors, explanations are no longer historically true, but they integrate into society more smoothly and allow more people to apply the Bible to their own lives. \nHowever, others may argue that the Catholic Bible and many other religious texts are legitimate historical records. However, to what extent is this true? As a student, I find it very difficult to ignore the scientific evidence we have today and believe the events of the Bible occurred. For instance, I learned that the story of Noah’s Ark, which states that all humans were killed in a flood, except for Noah and the animals he saved; however, through reasoning, many would find this story highly illogical and absurd. Most of the stories of the Bible are simply too extraordinary to occur, and those who believe in the Bible as history may force their views onto others. In a rapidly changing world, such controversial biblical stories often cause uproar, causing debate about abortions, stem cell treatments and much more, resulting in the loss of these scientific advancements for all of society, impacting individuals who do not align themselves with religion, but are forced to live with rules governed by religious bodies. Furthermore, whether religious texts are true life events will always remain unknown to us. Therefore, these reasons compel me to believe that good explanations do not have to be true. For the Area of Knowledge Religious Knowledge Systems, everyone chooses to understand a religious text differently. When I was attending Catholic school, I found it extremely difficult to relate to these stories, because many would contradict my moral compass or sound completely absurd. In my opinion, applying the parables as metaphors for life, rather than true events, allows for more individuals to relate to the Bible and aid us in life, rather than contradict life.\nSince doing the ToK program, I began to wonder about the point of being taught old, invalid scientific theories. However, I am glad I learned these theories, because without learning them, there would be holes in my knowledge. Additionally, these models provide insight into the ever constant human endeavor for progress that I have come to appreciate and hopefully pursue in my own life. Furthermore, in the case of Religious Knowledge Systems, I was taught to believe that Biblical events were true and I rebelled against the Bible because the events would contradict my scientific beliefs. However, as I got older, I began to view the Bible differently, and by using the Bible as an allegorical text, rather than a history textbook, I was able to extract meanings and messages that provide meaning and understanding in my life. \nIn conclusion, through the Areas of Knowledge of Natural Sciences and Religious Knowledge systems, I firmly believe that good explanations do not have to be true. When evaluating the “goodness” of an explanation it's trueness should only be one factor that determines its value. By teaching complex scientific theories to the general population, most will react with frustration, rather than enthusiasm; thus, I am grateful that teachers have taught me theories that are not completely true, because my enthusiasm is nurtured, I am motivated to continually gain knowledge. Furthermore, using the Bible as a metaphor invites everyone to interpret messages to their own personal understanding, allowing for the inclusion of all. Therefore, how explanations can change the lives of society should dictate its “goodness”. \n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/other/do-good-explanations-have-to-be-true/","title":"⚗️ Do good explanations have to be true?"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/other/food/":{"body":"Vancouver\nMello\n\nReview\nBad, stay away.

After some hardware issues, I reverted back to Windows. Well, this summer of 2021, I'm back to try to use Linux again. \nIt's been a month since I tried out Pop!_OS and here are my thoughts! I'll keep adding to this post as I continue to use Pop!_OS. For anyone else reading this, I have a HP Spectre 360x.\nSome differences from last summer:\n\n\nI'll be dual booting. There's some things on Windows, like better touchscreen support, that I use time to time. Additionally, if anything ever happens on my Linux setup, I can go back to my Windows setup. I recently completely removed Windows and now am only running Pop!_OS. \n\n\nI'll be trying out Pop!_OS this time vs. Ubuntu Budgie.\n\n\nStuff I like\n\nKeyboard shortcuts! Such a time saver. They are built into Pop!_OS so you don't need to do anything to set up them!\nSearching up applications: when I search for apps on Windows, I press the Windows key and then start typing. But since it has to switch from the menu to the search, there's always lag and it skips a few of the first characters. For instance, \"word\" becomes \"ord\". On Pop!_OS, search is SO fast.\nMy wifi doesn't break anymore? Before on Windows I was disconnected from my wifi everyday for a few minutes. Now it just doesn't happen when I use Linux. Weird...\nThe terminal: before I was using WSL2 which works, but there's downsides to it (file transfer is hella slow). Now with a Linux shell everything is so fast and it just works. \napt! !downloading programs is super easy with apt and there's also a pop shop!\nStuff just runs faster? In WSL2, the commands like code . and zola serve took at least 5-10 seconds to run. In Pop!_OS it's almost instant.\nNOTIFICATIONS DON'T COME FROM THE BOTTOM RIGHT. If Windows moved their notifications to anywhere but the bottom right, I'd consider using Windows again. \nTiling and Stacking is so fast and so convenient. I'm not sure how I was able to use Windows now that I use these features...\n\n\n\nSo fast 😍 and no mouse involved. And yes, I am using the macOS background.\nStuff I miss\n\nI miss the touchscreen support for drawing. It's not really usable on Linux because I kinda lost all the hardware/drivers support. But I knew this could be an issue.\nNotion: there's no official Notion desktop application for Linux. But no worries, I used this. Unfortunately, is seems like there is no longer support for it so I'll have to see how it goes...\nMonitor support: On Windows, it matches the resolution or something so that applications don't look too small or too large on screens of different sizes (something called fractional scaling). Sadly, this is very slow on Pop!_OS. This means I can only have applications in one resolution size, so stuff on my moniter might look a bit big and stuff on my laptop screen might look a bit small. But after a few weeks I've gotten used to this.\n\nProblems\n\nThe bluetooth is kinda buggy, but this reddit post helped kinda fix it? \nGestures didn't work out of the box but after installing Touchegg they seem to work now.\nI don't like 21.04 as much (and it was crashing my laptop).

And the public, still enamored with the power of algorithms to automate human tasks, freely delegate vital human activities to algorithms, in the hopes of saving some time, but often at the expense of justice.\n\nTeaching Algorithms\nteaching algorithms as canon\n\nlearn about efficiency of algorithms, differences between algorithms and practice implementing algorithms\n\"creates a sense of membership in the CS community, where most members had to learn the same ideas\"\nbut it's hard to learn algorithms as canon:\n\n\nStudents demonstrate an abundance of misconceptions about how canonical algorithms behave, including difficulties with data structures and how canonical algorithms manipulate them. Teaching algorithms in the abstract (or with lightweight problem contexts, such as situating search algorithms in a specific problem domain), can make algorithms feel separate from the world. The result is that students often struggle to develop self-efficacy with algorithms, especially with algorithm design and analysis.\n\n\nthere are methods to engage students themselves as data for the algorithm: sorting themselves in a list, but may not be an effective way to teach algorithms:\n\n\nThese methods can be engaging ways of visualizing algorithm behavior, but some evidence suggests that the older students are, the more awkward they might find the physical interaction with their peers, and the less likely they are to view these visualization activities as authentic practice. Other results with middle school students suggest that the physical embodiment involved is hard for students to link to the substantially different representations of algorithms they find in code, and that they actually decreased students’ desire to further study CS.\n\nteaching algorithms as infrastructure\n\ncanon is already taught in post secondary CS education, so might now be worth the time to teach in secondary education.\nmost students will never implement a canonical algorithm themselves, and will use an already implemented version of it.\n\n\nspending significant time teaching students to understand algorithms that have already been invented takes time away from the very different challenges of designing algorithms to solve problems in the world, and evaluating how well algorithms might solve problems. These are just as, if not more important to students who eventually pursue CS careers, but also important to those who won’t, as critically evaluating the quality of algorithms is something everyone that interacts with computers must do.\n\n\nteaching algorithms related to society poses different challenges\n\n\nThe critical question about algorithms, then, is not how to automate something with an algorithm, but whether to and why.\n\nAbstractions\nUsing APIs requires different knowledge:\n\nDomain Knowledge: knowledge about the domain in the world that the API is modeling and how it is modeling it\nExecution Semantics: how a function in an API behaves (types of input, how input maps to output, errors that could be produced, how long the function takes, how accurate the results are)\nUsage patterns: functions may have to be used in a particular way (input may have to be preprocessed).\n\n\nThis means that anyone that creates software — professional software developers, hobbyists, students learning CS in classes — will necessarily be engaging in informal learning about API abstractions, usually without well-designed instructional materials to support them.\nThus, while removing details through abstraction can make complex things easier to use, it does not make them easy to use.\n\nsocial tradeoffs of abstraction\n\nalgorithms centralize decision making\nfunctions, classes, APIs -&gt; centralizing decisions\nand privatize decision making\n\n\nTherefore, encapsulation by private companies is a transfer of power from the transparent, public, human processes, to opaque, private, algorithmic processes. \n\n\nalso abstraction is a form of automation\n\nautomation is a vessel for hiding social consequences of automation \n\n\n\nteaching abstraction use\nteaching abstraction use: \n\nteach the use of functions through practicing conforming to the syntax of function calls, trying different inputs, using functions in combination\nbut also requires coverage of domain concepts, execution semantics and design patterns\n\nbest way to learn these things is through documentation, but documentation is hard to read\n\nthis results in students being confused, copying code they don't understand\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother challenge with teaching APIs, especially in project-based learning, is that no API can support every imaginable thing a student might want to make.\n\n\nThe expressive power of an API to make many things possible is also a great risk to teaching, as students may find themselves needing to learn ideas that no one in the class, including the teacher, knows anything about. \n\nteaching abstraction design\n\nHtDP: design recipes (CPSC 110!)\n\n\nStudents often struggle to self-regulate during such structured problem solving, often deviating from the sequence, or struggling to independently perform a particular aspect of the process.\n\n\nbut not everyone may want to program, but they should still understand the role abstraction plays in society.\ncode written years ago are in effect today and are making decisions today\n\n\nMoreover, teaching abstractions as apolitical has consequences: rather than connecting students with the rich history of code that others have written over the past decades, abstractions and their goal of encapsulate and hide details, can create a kind of “wall” between students the ideas contained in them. This tradeoff, especially in the context of integrating CS into other disciplines, may actually harm literacy, as it eliminates opportunities to critically examine the assumptions and models embedded in abstractions.\n\n\nThis is a tradeoff in learning objectives: students who focus on designing functions will be more capable of writing programs to solve particular computational problems, but may not see the social problems they might create with their designs, whereas students who focus on critically examining the implications of functions might see their consequences more clearly, but be less well positioned to design them. \n\n\nlearn designing and use in university, critically examine in secondary school\n\nArtificial Intelligence\n\nsymbolic AI (using logic) vs statistical (using patterns in probabilities)\nstrong AI is out of reach\n\n\nIn contrast, other applications of AI often enrich and liberate groups that already have power and wealth.\nAI, then, just like any other code, is often deployed as a tool of wealthy, dominant groups to accrue power, increase wealth, and maintain the matrix of oppression that erases diversity, denies equity, and shuns equality.\n\nTeaching AI\n\n\nTeaching AI Theory\n\n\nTeaching AI application\n\n\nData is a record of the past; past injustices perpetuated into the future\n\n\nData encodes values, assumptions, goals of people who create it\n\n\nProgramming\n\nrequirement of self-regulated skills\nprocess monitoring: reflecting on the process, like checking if you are following your plan\ncomprehension monitoring: asking if you understand what happens if you change something in your code/do you know enough to change your code\nself explanation\n\n\nSociety has not yet broadly decided to make programmers responsible for their code and its impact, and until it does, making room for algorithmic justice will require personal and organizational will.\n\nVerification and Debugging\nTools\nProjects\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/papers/compsci/ccc/","title":"Notes for: Critically Conscious Computing: Methods for Secondary Education"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/papers/compsci/code-or-not/":{"body":"Paper\n\nTo that end we therefore ask, what must a functioning member of our society know about computing?\n\nHumans have always tried to consolidate information, at first it was with books that were static and hard to add new information to, and now it's Wikipedia and Google. Because there was less information to document back then, it was easier to know what information was useful. Now there's a lot of information, but information has it's time and place and it's hard to know what information to learn or understand at a period in time. Which raises the question in this article: \"To that end we therefore ask, what must a functioning member of our society know about computing?\"\n\nCharles Babbage was a product of church but a scientist, and had the view that information could be mechanized. Babbage wished that \"calculations had been executed by steam\" because he was working on stuff and had errors in the calculations which were done by hand.\nAda Lovelace expressed this new way of thinking: “We may say most aptly that the Analytic Engine weaves algebraic patterns just as the Jacquard loom weaves flowers and leaves.”\n\nGrady Booch says that \"productive members of society must grasp the essence of the human-made cosmos around them.\" But whether or not that means to learn how to code, Grady mentions we should learn computational thinking: \nBut we must \"be careful to not teach coding as just a vocational skill\". A vocational skill is \"practical or firsthand skills that help a person master a trade or a job\".\nI express the same view here and here.\n\n\"Rather, I think it’s essential that we fundamentally teach the notion of computational thinking, a point of view first proposed by Jeannette Wing. As she defines it, “Computational thinking involves solving problems, designing systems, and understanding human behavior by drawing on the concepts fundamental to computer science. Computational thinking includes a range of mental tools that reflect the breadth of the field of computer science”\"\n\nGrady also mentions that Wing's ideas parallel with Carl Sagan's, who observed \"science is much more than a body of knowledge. It is a way of thinking\"\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/papers/compsci/code-or-not/","title":"Grady Booch: To Code or Not to Code, That Is the Question"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/papers/compsci/end-of-computing-science/":{"body":"PDF Version\nText Version\nprof. dr. Edsger W. Dijkstra talks about how \n\ncomputing has \"matured\" from a theoretical topic for the scientists to a practical issue for the engineers, managers and the entrepreneurs\n\nAs a student who has felt a disconnect between a computer science degree and the jobs people pursue with a computer science degree, I resonate with this statement very well. \nI like computer science, but not the tech industry. The elegance and beauty of computer science has been diminished to slow, inefficient JavaScript programs full of bugs and security vulnerabilities with flashy marketing, and these embarrassing programs are praised by managers, venture capitalists, and PMs who have little care and almost no desire to understand and appreciate computer science. \n\nwho can accept the application of science for the obvious benefits, but feel rather uncomfortable with its creation because they don't understand what the doing of research, with its intangible goals and its uncertain rewards, entails.\n\nThe eventual application of science can only be possible through research. You can't apply a formula that hasn't had years of research and theory behind it. Even though the application of chemistry (drugs) inspires me to pursue studies in chemistry, drugs can only be discovered and conceptualized through hours and hours of thinking and going in circles. For a long time, I was scared of research too. At my first internship I'd spend hours after my work day had ended thinking about a problem I was stuck on. I'd spend an entire week trying to implement a solution and show up to my weekly meeting to only present nothing to the lead surgeon and professor. I also made a mistake, and spent 2 days unable to focus because of the fear of disappointing my research team. Research can painful and can drive you insane. But when you accomplish something, no matter how small, that feeling is better than any feeling I've ever felt in any industry job.\n\nI would therefore like to posit that computing's central challenge, viz. \"How not to make a mess of it\", has not been met. On the contrary, most of our systems are much more complicated than can be considered healthy, and are too messy and chaotic to be used in comfort and confidence. The average customer of the computing industry has been served so poorly that he expects his system to crash all the time, and we witness a massive worldwide distribution of bug-ridden software for which we should be deeply ashamed.\n\nIn organic chemistry we learn so many different pathways to the same drug. In the next year's organic chemistry course we learn why some pathways are unfeasible. We lose points on exams for coming up with dangerous or lengthy pathways. There are strict protocols and standards for creating drugs and a lot more thought into creating drugs. You can take Advil (within a healthy dosage) and not expect something dangerous to happen. \nBut can you say this about software? In courses, I'm rarely judged on my actual code, but rather if my code can pass some tests. Inefficient and unreadable code is given the same grade as efficient and maintainable code. There's no incentive to do better. In fact, at my Microsoft internship I was told to avoid refactoring code, and faced much opposition when I presented a PR with refactored code. PRs with untested features were accepted quicker than my PR that just refactored code. My manager, who never cared about what I did prior to the code refactor, suddenly pulled me into a meeting to ask if the code refactor really was necessary. And there were no bugs discovered in my refactored code.\nOur apps have became more and more bloated, with data leaks every hour, and having something \"work\" isn't the norm, but the outlier. Companies deliberately choose horrible languages to write programs in like JavaScript, push confusing design changes instead of security improvements and freeze our computers with memory leaks. I can say with confidence that every single person has probably had some type of personal data leaked. I had my first leak of personal data thanks to LinkedIn.\nEven worse, software has poisoned people. Perhaps this could of been avoided if we verified the correctness of the software, but apparently we've decided verifying most programs is too costly, and instead poured billions of dollars into memory and energy draining flashy AI models that have proven almost 100% of the time to be racist and down right horrifying.\nWindows crashes once a week, and I have to move my schedule around for software; shouldn't it be the other way around? Software should cater to us. \n\nFor us scientists it is very tempting to blame the lack of education of the average engineer, the short-sightedness of the managers and the malice of the entrepreneurs for this sorry state of affairs, but that won't do. You see, while we all know that unmastered complexity is at the root of the misery, we do not know what degree of simplicity can be obtained, nor to what extent the intrinsic complexity of the whole design has to show up in the interfaces.\n\nThe statement \"unmastered complexity is the root of misery\" could be talking about the Dunning-Kruger effect, in which Silicon Valley tech bros go around creating short sighted solutions without the input of the groups affected, which then cause harms to others. Or the statement could be talking about the state of a researcher, who may feel misery and despair due to their lack of mastery in the topic they are researching. I feel is it the latter. \n\nWe do not know yet whether trade-offs will be possible. We do not know yet whether we can invent for intricacy a meaningful concept about which we can prove theorems that help. \n\nA professor once stated to my boyfriend who then told me, that \"optimization is optimization until your optimization produces something wrong, and if that happens then you're cheating\". I believe this is what these \"trade-offs\" are talking about. There's a lot of trade-offs in science in hopes of making a topic simpler. We use the Bohr model to represent the electrons and protons for an element; but there's a trade-off. The trade-off is that for simplicity we may give students the impression that electrons orbit in circles or ovals or that electrons stay \"stuck\" in orbit. This is an \"optimization\". And sometimes optimizations can become cheating; an optimization works until it can't. Obviously catching these cheating optimizations is important, but how can we? I think that is what prof. dr. Edsger W. Dijkstra's second sentence implies.\n\nWe do not know yet whether intrinsic intricacy can be distinguished from accidental intricacy.  ... To put it bluntly, we simply do not know yet what we should be talking about, but that should not worry us, for it just illustrates what was meant by \"intangible goals and uncertain rewards\".\n\nResearch is a dive into the unknown. For instance, virologists for many years have noticed that certain biomarkers, like, intracellular miRNAs that were down regulated were exosomal-associated miRNA. Exosomes with miRNA were exiting the cell. For the previous years, not much focus was given on these miRNAs; they were thought as perhaps a byproduct of the influenza virus. But what was causing this down regulation? Was it even associated with the influenza virus (accidental intricacy or intrinsic intricacy?). And what molecule, foreign or self, was causing this? Well, virologists found out that miR-24, which was leaving the cell, correlated with an increased expression of furin in H5N1 strain of influenza. Previously ignored, miRNA has become a key factor in the viral life cycle. Most importantly is that virologists didn't know they were looking for miRNA. \nIn fact, microRNAs (miRNA) are non-coding RNA, which means they don't become proteins themselves, but influence what and how much of the coding RNA become proteins. This makes it really hard to study since there's \"nothing\" we can grasp onto. There's no protein to take a closer look at. We can only make guesses on which proteins are affected by the billions of non-coding regions. These molecules were discovered in worms in 1993 and only known to exist in humans in the last decade. Since we have only analyzed mostly coding regions of the genome, miRNAs are a completely new area. \nWhy do I talk about virology research? Well, I hope I made it clear that no one knew what they were looking for. Computing Science is still a relatively new area of research that has so much to be explored. Unfortunately, lots of money has been poured into AI, which other areas like ethics, hardware, compiler, proof verification and more much more underfunded. We need to do research that has \"intangible goals and uncertain rewards\". Research in AI seems to contradict this statement. There's always a goal: make machines more like humans or make machines replace humans. And there's always a desired reward: money. \n\nThe moral is that whether Computing Science is finished will primarily depend on our courage and our imagination.\n\nResearch isn't all knowledge, as probably almost every researcher has told you. There's also imagination and intuition and courage. You can't be driven by goals like money or status. Science doesn't care if you can figure out why something happens or prove why something is right. Science owes nothing to you. All we can do is keep imagining and pushing the field of computing science forward. \n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/papers/compsci/end-of-computing-science/","title":"E. W.
