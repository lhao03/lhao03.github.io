<p>I was inspired by <a href="https://blog.matthewwang.me/stats/song-of-the-week.html" class="highlight"
        target="_blank">Matt's Song of the Week</a> to start tracking the new songs I discover or can't stop listening
    to each week!
</p>

<h3>why so much kpop??</h3>
<p>Why not ðŸ˜›? But for real, there's something about not understanding the lyrics that I really enjoy about kpop. I get
    to "guess" the vibe of the song and sometimes I'm right! But sometimes I'm very wrong. Don't worry though,
    this doesn't mean I don't listen to English songs!</p>
