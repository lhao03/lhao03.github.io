Hello, welcome to my plethora of thoughts. I enjoy learning about how and why things work, especially pertaining to quantum chemistry, physical chemistry and a bit of programming language theory and synthetic biology. I'm interested in predicting the behavior of molecules and biological entities using theory and computation!

List of things currently doing (in no particular order): 

- playing [Legends of Runeterra](https://playruneterra.com/en-us/) and TFT
- reading fantasy books
- co-leading dry lab and leading the wiki team at UBC iGEM, where I'm creating an [internal documentation](https://github.com/UBC-iGEM/internal-wiki-2023-24) system
- learning about quantum chemistry


See my ramblings [here](/archive) and what I'm currently [reading](/read). You can also see my [CV](/cv/cv.pdf) or [resume](/resume-lucy/resume-Lucy-Hao.pdf).
