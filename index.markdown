I'm a chemistry nerd and functional/[language orientated programming enthusiast](https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2018/3/225475-a-programmable-programming-language/fulltext) at the [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/). I enjoy learning about how and why things work, especially pertaining to quantum chemistry, thermodynamics and programming language theory. I also [read](/papers) about a bunch of random topics. 

Right now playing [Legends of Runeterra](https://playruneterra.com/en-us/), TFT and back in school!

See my ramblings [here](/archive) and the [papers I've read](/papers). You can also see my [CV](/cv/cv.pdf) or [resume](/resume-lucy/resume-Lucy-Hao.pdf).
