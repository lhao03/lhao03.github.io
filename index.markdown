## Dear reader,

Welcome to my plethora of thoughts. I enjoy learning about how and why things work, especially through the lens of analytical and physical chemistry. I also think ~~Racket~~ Rust is the best programming language.

## My current life...

I'm finishing up my last year of chemistry and computer science at UBC, where I am at the intersection of molecules, systems and algorithms. Some questions I have are: 

- how can computation be applied to chemical chaos?
- how can we develop more efficient and robust methods to predict and simulate chemical properties from first principles?
- and in the meantine, how can we develop scienfitically accurate machine learning methods for chemistry?

## My past life...

I was involved in participating and putting together events such as hackathons ([StarHacks](https://starhacks.devpost.com/), [cmd-f 2020](https://devpost.com/software/ecoeats-sgwzhp)) and panels for minority groups in computing. I have also interned at Microsoft and Capital One, forming close friendships with people from all over Canada and the USA! Through these experiences, I've met lots of great people that I'm inspired by everyday. While I don't see myself returning to the software industry (for now), I'm grateful for the people I've met and am excited to see what is next for me.
