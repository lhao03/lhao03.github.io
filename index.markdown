I'm a mathematically and functional/[language orientated programming enthusiast](https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2018/3/225475-a-programmable-programming-language/fulltext) at the [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/). I enjoy learning about how and why things work, especially pertaining to quantum chemistry, thermodynamics and programming language theory. I also [read](/read) about a bunch of random topics. 

List of things currently doing (in no particular order): 
- playing [Legends of Runeterra](https://playruneterra.com/en-us/) and TFT
- reading fantasy books
- creating an [internal documentation](https://github.com/UBC-iGEM/internal-wiki-2023-24) system at iGEM UBC
- learning about quantum chemistry


See my ramblings [here](/archive) and the [papers I've read](/papers). You can also see my [CV](/cv/cv.pdf) or [resume](/resume-lucy/resume-Lucy-Hao.pdf).
