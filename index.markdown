## Dear reader,

Welcome to my plethora of thoughts. I enjoy learning about how and why things work, especially through the lens of theoretical chemistry and physical chemistry. I also have opinions about programming language theory and try to do synthetic biology. 

## My current life...

I'm finishing up my last year of chemistry and computer science at UBC, where I like to believe that molecules behave like functions, allowing us to quantitatively characterize and predict their behaviour. As such, I'm a bottom-up thinker that gets lost in the details, which means I also get involved in areas where I have to think about the big picture, such as [iGEM](https://ubcigem.com/) and software; abstraction is a must here.

For fun, I like buying lots of types of artisanal coffee; a hobby I started since someone I'm close to was appalled I was drinking instant coffee everyday; and drink at minimum two cups a day! I also read fiction books and enjoy talking about nonsensical scenarios with the people I'm close to.

## My past life...

In my computer science era I was involved in participating and putting together events such as hackathons ([StarHacks](https://starhacks.devpost.com/), [cmd-f 2020](https://devpost.com/software/ecoeats-sgwzhp)) and panels for minority groups in computing, meeting lots of great people that I'm inspired by on the daily. I also interned at Microsoft and Capital One, forming close friendships with people from all over Canada and the USA! While I don't see myself returning to the software industry (for now), I'm grateful for the people I've met and am excited to see what is next for me.
