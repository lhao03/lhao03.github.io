I'm a chemistry nerd and functional/[language orientated programming enthusiast](https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2018/3/225475-a-programmable-programming-language/fulltext) at the [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/). I enjoy learning about how and why things work, especially pertaining to chemical biology, drugs, operating systems, compilers, and programming language theory. I also [read](/papers) about computing history, the impact of technological systems on society and computer science education. 

Right now I'm getting ready to apply to grad school, reviewing organic chemistry and learning about programming language theory!

See my ramblings [here](/archive) and the [papers I've read](/papers). You can also see my [CV](/cv/cv.pdf), or check out the [daily log](/log).
