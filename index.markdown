## Dear reader,

Welcome to my plethora of thoughts. I enjoy learning about how and why things work, especially through the lens of theoretical and physical chemistry. I also have opinions about programming language theory and I think Racket is the best programming language.

## My current life...

I'm finishing up my last year of chemistry and computer science at UBC, where I dabble in programming languages, computational optimization and modeling molecules with functions. Some questions I have are: 

- how can we develop methods to predict and elucidate chemical properties, using only first principles or semi-experimentally?
  - how can quantum mechanical models of chemistry be improved?
- how can computational optimization and formal methods in computer science be applied to chemistry? 

For fun, I like buying artisanal coffee, a hobby I started since someone I'm close to was appalled I was drinking instant coffee everyday; I drink at minimum two cups a day! I also read fiction books and enjoy talking about nonsensical scenarios.

## My past life...

I was involved in participating and putting together events such as hackathons ([StarHacks](https://starhacks.devpost.com/), [cmd-f 2020](https://devpost.com/software/ecoeats-sgwzhp)) and panels for minority groups in computing. I have also interned at Microsoft and Capital One, forming close friendships with people from all over Canada and the USA! Through these experiences, I've met lots of great people that I'm inspired by everyday. While I don't see myself returning to the software industry (for now), I'm grateful for the people I've met and am excited to see what is next for me.
