## websites i was inspired by (in no particular order):
- https://justina.tech/, http://jzhao.xyz/, https://www.katmh.com/, http://joicetang.com/, https://kristen.dev/

## why hugo to zola? and css to scss?
- hugo docs are confusing
- hugo feels like magic; i dont even know how it works 99% of the time
- scss has cool features like nesting
- i really like static website generators so i had to try out zola

## a comparison

## how to make it work
- install zola: https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/overview/
- to render the site ```zola serve```.
