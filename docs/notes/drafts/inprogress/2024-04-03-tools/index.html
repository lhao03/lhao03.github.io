<p>The evolution of humans has evolved around physical tools for centuries,
and such, the evolution of tools is a good marker for human progress. We often marvel at monkeys and birds for using rocks as a hammer, as early humans did. We then created hammers, and then automated hammers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It‚Äôs easy to see that physical tools were created to make a task easier or safer to accomplish. For instance, you could put a nail into a tree with a rock, but that‚Äôs dangerous, slow and tiring. So we made better tools for putting nails into solid surfaces. Physical tools also require some kind of constant input and different levels of tool competency can determine the effectiveness of the tool in use. Physical tools are also very hands on and require someone to have good vision, sometimes rendering the use of such a tool impossible, and essentially inaccessible to some, which is a concern if such a tool is the standard. And while physical tools make tasks easier, they are static, having no ability to become autonomous or react to the environment.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The most powerful being the steam engine and the computer. With the birth of the computer, another realm of tools have emerged, those being software based tools, which are arguably more powerful than physical tools. When software is coupled to a preexisting physical tool, the most canonical example being a robot, the possibilities are endless. People understand the utility of a robot very well, since robots are still a physically based tool that are often employed in dangerous environments or suboptimal environments like the surface of Mars. But when you ask someone to consider using Markdown instead of Google Docs, or to compute calculations with Python instead of Excel, you face an upward struggle. Inspired by teaching life science students Git, my frustrations in CHEM 211, and the podcast <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/ca/podcast/corecursive-coding-stories/id1330329512?i=1000643923572" class="bare">https://podcasts.apple.com/ca/podcast/corecursive-coding-stories/id1330329512?i=1000643923572</a>  I wanted to discuss the era of software tools and their lack of acceptance by the general public.</p>
