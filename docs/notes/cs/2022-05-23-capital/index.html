* which means that many instructors lack formal training in education and basic knowledge of learning theories.
* Since the instructors’ background in technical education does not prepare them for teaching, they lack training in diversity-conscious pedagogy and critical understanding of how learning communities, regardless of their formal or informal nature, are transmitters of the dominant culture. Foor et al. [37] argues that a first step for educators to change this dominant culture is to examine the underlying beliefs of the CS culture and how they impact learners.</p>

<p>‘For each scientific space (as for any field in any area of social activity), the identification of the efficient properties and resources and, accordingly, of the dominant forms of capital, remains an empirical question’. As a result, the theory of science capital is inadequate to understand the mechanisms behind students’ aspirations and trajectory in CS.</p>

<ul>

<p>There is, however, a distinguishing difference between CS and other fields of natural science. Previous studies have found that students who went on to study CS in higher education do so either because they have developed a lifelong, passionate interest for computers [59, 68, 76] or because they saw computing as a tool for self-expression, e.g. their broader interest in computing technology and society [40, 54, 71]. Although both of these student groups have positive views of CS, their understanding of the usefulness and values of CS in their daily lives differed.</p>

<p>Previous studies have highlighted a lack of understanding or a misunderstanding of what CS entails and stereotypical views of computer scientists as barriers to attracting students from diverse backgrounds to the field</p>

<p>However, knowledge of the opportunities that a CS degree can offer must be aligned with students’ various intrinsic values to study CS, otherwise the motivation to persist could be easily undermined.</p>

<p>A state-wide study by Guzdial et al. [41] found that male students were more likely to mention computer games and programming as the reason they chose computing as their major or minor. On the other hand, female students were more likely to choose computing because of their societal interests.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Previous studies have also found evidence that the consumption of computer games and CS-related media is uneven for boys and girls, resulting in differences in access to cultural capital related to CS.</p>
