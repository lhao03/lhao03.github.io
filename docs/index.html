          <h2>☕</h2>
          <h2 id="dear-reader">Dear reader,</h2>
<p>Welcome to my plethora of thoughts. I enjoy learning about how and why things work, especially through the lens of theoretical chemistry and physical chemistry. I also have opinions about programming language theory and try to do synthetic biology.</p>
<h2 id="my-current-life">My current life…</h2>
<p>I’m finishing up my last year of chemistry and computer science at UBC, where I like to believe that molecules behave like functions, allowing us to quantitatively characterize and predict their behaviour. As such, I’m a bottom-up thinker that gets lost in the details, which means I also get involved in areas where I have to think about the big picture, such as <a href="https://ubcigem.com/">iGEM</a> and software; abstraction is a must here.</p>
<p>For fun, I like buying lots of types of artisanal coffee; a hobby I started since someone I’m close to was appalled I was drinking instant coffee everyday; and drink at minimum two cups a day! I also read fiction books and enjoy talking about nonsensical scenarios with the people I’m close to.</p>
<h2 id="my-past-life">My past life…</h2>
<p>In my computer science era I was involved in participating and putting together events such as hackathons (<a href="https://starhacks.devpost.com/">StarHacks</a>, <a href="https://devpost.com/software/ecoeats-sgwzhp">cmd-f 2020</a>) and panels for minority groups in computing, meeting lots of great people that I’m inspired by on the daily. I also interned at Microsoft and Capital One, forming close friendships with people from all over Canada and the USA! While I don’t see myself returning to the software industry (for now), I’m grateful for the people I’ve met and am excited to see what is next for me.</p>
