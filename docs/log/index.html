<p>nyc day 2. arrived last night very tired. currently just vibing. wall street is pretty nice. the architecture in nyc is very variable. sometimes it reminds me of downtown vancouver. took a walk around, there’s a body of water and i saw people with ice cream but i couldn’t figure out where they were getting that ice cream. also there’s just like trash bags everywhere.</p>

<p>was trying to get some rust stuff to work and it wasn’t and that kinda annoyed me. i don’t think i like "learning through hacking". i like having enough knowledge to "figure it out myself", so to speak. i don’t think i don’t like "unfamiliar problems" but i really hate just feeling like i’m in the dark. in chemistry and cpsc 110, i’d frequently do "hard problems" or "new problems" (of course to a computer scientist or chemist these problems aren’t hrd or new but to a noob like me they are.) like my ochem class kicked my ass, and we had to literally create reaction mechanisms for chemical molecules that don’t exist. there’s no "search that chemical molecule up on google" because my chem proof literally pulled it out of his brain. anyways, people always say "you didn’t waste your time" when you struggle to learn. when i’ve spent 4 hours trying to think of a reaction mechanism i’ve reinforced my knowledge of chemistry and i now "know what doesn’t work and why". but when i "learn through hacking" and i come across the solution by luck after like 5 hours, i just feel like i’ve wasted all this time. i don’t know why what i was doing doesn’t work and why this random internet solution does work.</p>

<p>i was never the kid who "put computers together" like lmfao. i just read books about fairies and shit. my dad bought me a circuit game thing, and i put together the circuits, saw the light blink and was like ok.</p>

<p>ubc does course registration based on your year standing, and i majorly fucked
up in second year by not making sure i was taking enough cs/math courses to be
promoted to third year (i was 0.4 credits away from being promoted to third
year standing). since i was stuck in second year standing, i got a shit
registration time (second year students are the last to register for courses),
so this meant i got "whatever was left" and i couldn’t register for literally
any third year CS courses even though the only second year courses i only left
to do were the required second year math courses. i randomly got a seat into
cspc 313 because i kept checking the ssc every like 5 mins and then was one of
the last students to get moved off the waitlist into cpsc 320. and then i saw
like at least 10-20 people drop the third year cs courses i wanted to take but
i couldnt register for since it was past the register date, and i wasn’t keen
on joining a course like 3 weeks into it. since i could only register for 2
third year courses i couldn’t get promoted to fourth year (this is my fourth
year at ubc but im in third year standing now). and now i have to do a bunch of
course schedule juggling between my chem and cs courses, and one of the cs
courses i was planning to take suddenly changed times and that threw my whole
schedule out of balance and now i’m replanning my next two years again. in
second year i was a super confused student, and i was exploring courses in micb
and chem, instead of taking the required math courses, and i feel like i was
punished for "exploring". i kinda wish i had an advisor (my friend at an ivy
school gets assigned their own advisor and they meet like a few times
throughout the year). anyways i guess i feel stressed, because course planning
is just another thing i have to worry about along with all the stuff happening
in the world.</p>
