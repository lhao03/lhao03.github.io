<div class="paragraph">
<p>More and more students use a computer in their daily lives but have
little to no understanding of the inner workings of computers, models of
computation, or computer programs. Using a computer is like riding the
bus; it’s just how life is. You may use Google Docs because your school
requires you to. Ignoring the capitalistic argument for pursuing
computer science, I don’t think many students are passionate or enjoy
learning about computer science solely to just learn how a computer
works. Rather, students want to learn about the vocational skills
associated with computer science, while ignoring the theory. That may be
because the link between computer science and society, or the impacts of
computer science (besides Big Tech and AI, where there’s a lot of money
involved) is hard to see.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If we look at other sciences, like math or chemistry, the students in
that major are more passionate about what they are studying. For
example, chemistry is a large field, and as a chemistry major, you’re
required to take chemistry courses in a range of topics such as organic
chemistry, quantum chemistry, physical chemistry, inorganic chemistry,
etc. A chemist should have a basic understanding of the range of topics
in chemistry because many areas involve more than one specialty. I’ve
rarely witnessed students complain in my chemistry classes about a
certain topic being "useless" because most students appreciate that a
good chemist understands a wide range of areas in chemistry. Of course,
someone may be more interested in applying chemistry, rather than
learning the theory and engaging in research. For them, a degree in
chemical engineering (which I’ve heard is very different) could be a
better fit.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But it’s different in my computer science classes. I see and hear
frequent complaints about how a student will "nEvEr tOuCh hArdWarE
aGAiN" and that they just "hope to pass" a course to graduate and
move on to their Big Tech™️ job. Then there are students who complain
that a computer science degree was "useless" for their job in web
development because they weren’t taught React, JavaScript, and other web
technologies. A good computer scientist will, like a chemist, have a
basic understanding of a wide range of topics. Unlike the chemical
engineering degree, there’s no "Software Engineering" discipline in
most Canadian universities. There’s only computer engineering and
electrical engineering, which most computer science students would stay
far away from since so many of them dislike hardware so much. There
seems to be a large distaste for hardware from most computer science
students. Anyways, this begs the question, of whether there should be
another degree or "pathway" for someone that just wants to do web
development, as that is what most software jobs are these days. Most
software jobs seem to stress vocational skills, but computer science
degrees in Canada are very theoretical.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With that being said, a computer science degree is still the most common
degree for a software job. Since software is such an important and
overreaching part of society, and I believe that just vocational skills
aren’t enough to get a job in software, because you must understand why
something is the way it is or how something could fail. Nonetheless, a
job as a software engineer requires coding and learning various
technologies, with less emphasis on theoretical topics commonly taught
in university. Should that be the responsibility of the university to
teach these technologies over concepts? I’m not sure. But nowadays
Canadian universities are teaching a mix of both for computer science,
though much more emphasis on theoretical concepts. But how do we best
teach theoretical concepts alongside programming language skills and
proficiency?</p>

<p>Educators like Amy J. Ko, Ph.D. hope that more people, especially from
minority groups, can get involved in computer science. However, it’s a
challenge: even though there are more women in other areas like medicine
and business than in previous years, you can’t say the same for computer
science. Researchers from
UCLA<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_4" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_4" title="View footnote.">4</a>]</sup> have
pointed out:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Women who take intro-to-CS classes tend to be further
along in their college careers than men, and they are usually not CS
majors. Since women are better represented in CS intro courses (32%)
than among actual CS degree earners (16% among BRAID schools), BRAID
researchers believe that CS intro classes are particularly significant
in whether a student chooses to go down the CS pathway.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Lehman stresses that students’ first impressions about CS are shaped by
these introductory classes, especially because women, on average, are
less likely to have taken a CS class in high school.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When it comes to programming, you first have to master how to learn

the students have some background in coding, it can put some students at
a disadvantage."</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>"If someone stays in the major, it’s usually because
they have strong peer connections," she says. "When they leave, it’s

to help people."</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is one problem computer science educators are trying to solve: how
do we relate computer science to a student’s life? How do we show that
computers can contribute to the social good? How can we make computer
science personally resonate with a student?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A student’s first exposure to computer science is usually through
programming. Most computer science courses you take will have a
programming component, as did my first computer science course. However,
in CPSC 110, I couldn’t understand or see why learning recursion or
coding up binary trees related to anything! After my first year, I was
ready to leave my major in computer science for one in chemistry, where
I had a dream of discovering drugs to cure diseases. Unfortunately, many
other people may experience the same feeling of being divorced from
their studies in computer science.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In Critically Conscience Computing, Amy J. Ko, Ph.D. talks about several ways programming is
usually taught, and the positives and negatives of the different
methods. Having TAed CPSC 110 and CPSC 210, and
taken some computer science courses, I’ve
noticed some differences between how programming is taught, and thus the
differences in students’ reactions to the course.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>CPSC 110 and CPSC 210 are based on teaching students a type of
programming paradigm. In CPSC 110, students are taught to think in a
functional paradigm, while in CPSC 210, students are taught to think in
an object orientated programming paradigm. Both courses tackle teaching
students how to program in a particular paradigm with a different
method: CPSC 110 uses problem sets and labs while CPSC 210 uses a self
driven project and labs. I’ll be discussing problem sets and self driven
projects.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_problem_sets">Problem Sets</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After students go to a lecture, they must practice the knowledge they
have learned to understand how to apply it. Simply reading or watching
someone code does not imply a student can also code. The most common,
consistent, and probably the easiest way to teach programming is through
problem sets. Professors can also easily evaluate a student’s ability to
program through problem sets. Problems sets are also an easy way for an
instructor to see a student’s struggles and progress during a course
because problem sets can be issued after every lecture, or at some
consistent time interval, with questions targeting specific concepts or
lectures.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most courses at UBC use problem sets to evaluate a student’s
understanding of course content. I’ll define a problem set as a set of
problems that every student works on, and there’s usually one solution
that the professor is looking for, though a few alternatives exist.
There are usually some "test cases" that have to pass. There’s some
implementation freedom in a student’s answers, but they must pass these
"test cases".</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>CPSC 110 uses problem sets to judge a student’s ability to do domain
analysis and to apply the appropriate template to a particular problem.
Students don’t just get to pass the test cases though! There’s a human
graded portion and students are called up at least once throughout the
term to discuss their solutions with the TAs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Since students will all do the same problem set, this ensures some level
of fairness, since all students will be answering the same problems.
However, as Critically Conscience Computing mentions, problems sets may be divorced from
someone’s life. Most problem set questions may involve questions like
"Traverse a tree numbers" or "Generate all the possible outcomes for
a set of clowns". If a student is not intrinsically already interested
in computer science, these types of questions in problem sets are
usually divergent from a student’s interests and may make them less
interested in computer science as a whole. I experienced this same
feeling. I couldn’t see or understand how these problem sets would give
me skills to contribute positively to society.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, because problem sets are often divorced from
students’ lives, many students struggle to find a relationship between
the abstract ideas of programming languages and their interests, values,
and passions, limiting their motivation to learn.</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While problem sets ensure a student is up to a standard of knowledge (if
they can complete the problem set correctly, this means they have
understood most of the material), they can feel rigid and impersonal to
a student. Something even worse is that students, especially women,
could struggle on a problem set and decide that since they struggled so
much solving questions on a problem set they didn’t feel any personal
connection to, to not pursue any further studies in computer science
(that was I how felt my first year of university).</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The result of this approach is that students often
rapidly lose any self-efficacy they began with, struggling to design,
test, and debug without guidance, often converging towards a fixed
mindset that they were simply not a "born" programmer</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>During my time TAing CPSC 110, students who struggled usually continued
to struggle throughout the term. Students aren’t allowed to discuss or
ask about problem sets to TAs or other students, meaning much of the
problem set must be solved by themselves, without much guidance. Thus,
students who struggled on the first problem set usually struggled on the
next and the next ones, with some students eventually dropping the
course.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A possible solution to helping students’ feel more personally engaged
with programming is to center a course around being project-based, which
I will discuss below.</p>
</div>
<details>
<summary class="title">An Aside</summary>
<div class="content">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Amy J. Ko, Ph.D. also discuss how students may have a brittle
understanding of the programming language, further impeding their
ability to complete problem sets. I think that CPSC 110 tries to remedy
this problem by using BSL (and later ISL and ASL), a small teaching
language with a simple syntax and grammar designed for educational
purposes<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_5" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_5" title="View footnote.">5</a>]</sup>. The design of BSL is intentional such that all the
features of BSL are all the features a student needs at a current stage
in the course. BSL is then extended to ISL to include new concepts the
student is learning. New data structures are introduced in lecture then
introduced in the programming language. An example is <code>cons</code> and <code>list</code>.
Students first learn to structure arbitrary sized data using <code>cons</code> in
BSL. Then in ISL, they can use syntactic sugar <code>list</code>!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some reasoning behind choosing a programming language for a course from
Matthias Felleisen, creator of HtDP which CPSC 110 is based on:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When it comes to choosing a language for the first
course, we must take into account the above goals and two relevant
theorems:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Theorem 1</strong> Novice programmers make mistakes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Theorem 2</strong> A compiler and the run-time system articulate error messages
under the assumption that the programmer knows the entire language.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These theorems have three immediate consequences relevant to
Fundamentals I:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Corollary 1</strong> An introductory course cannot serve a wide spectrum of
complete novices if it uses an off-the-shelf (industrial) language.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Examples of ill-suited languages include C++, Java, JavaScript, Python,
Racket, and Scheme—even though they are, or were, used for first
courses. Pascal is also too large, even though Wirth explicitly
motivated Pascal as a "small teaching language."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Corollary 2</strong> Reducing the size of the language improves its error
messages.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Corollary 3</strong> An introductory course needs a series of small languages
that suffice to illustrate the design recipes.</p>
</div>

<cite><a href="https://felleisen.org/matthias/Thoughts/Developing_Developers.html">Developing Developers</a></cite>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To put it briefly, programming languages like C require an understanding
of pointers and memory management, before doing something like working
with arbitrary sized data. Even with a higher level programming
language, industry languages (like Java and Python) have too many
features and confusing error messages, which can overwhelm students who
have never programmed before.</p>
</div>
</div>
</details>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_project_based_courses">Project-based courses</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Project-based courses aim to offer a personalized and individualized
component for the student. Students can conceptualize their project,
usually adhering to some rules that require using a certain programming
language or implementing concepts like object-orientated design.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In CPSC 210, students were very excited to discuss with me what they
wanted to build. This is probably one of the most exciting things about
computer science: building things! My office hours also felt different
in comparison to CPSC 110. During my TA office hours, students also came
to me to fix a bug in a feature they were implementing. They talked
about "fixing the bug that adds something twice to my shopping cart"
rather than "I don’t understand how recursion works."</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This approach overcomes many of the problems of direct
instruction, because when students encounter problems with their
programs, students might see those problems as authentic challenges of
realizing their vision, rather than failures to meet a rigid,
instructor-defined notion of success. There is substantial evidence that
student-driven project-based learning greatly improves interest in CS,
motivation to learn, and engagement, and some evidence that this is
associated with increases in student learning of programming language
concepts.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, students who are unfamiliar with the programming language or who
are not experienced programmers, have the extra challenge of learning a
programming language, in CPSC 210’s case this would be Java. Coupled
with the freedom of designing their own project, this can cause a
project to flop.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because students creatively explore their vision by
modifying code, this brittle understanding of a programming language’s
rules may also make it harder to change a program, because students may
not understand precisely how their code is executing, limiting a
students’ ability to realize their vision. Finally, and perhaps most
significantly, because learning new programming language features is
difficult, students with a fixed mindset may start with elaborate
visions, realize that they have to learn particular language features,
and then reduce their vision to avoid learning.</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Over my two terms TAing CPSC 210, I’ve always witnessed a student’s
vision for their project become less and less than what they had
described to me. Many students begin designing their projects before
having an adequate understanding of the programming language they are
using, so many students inevitably overshoot and overcomplicate their
projects. Of course, many of us over estimate what we can do, but for a
student who is new to programming, this can mean that a student
simplifies their program based on the level of their understanding of
the programming language, resulting in "superficial programs that,
while enabling students to express their interests to some extent, do
not necessarily result in a robust or comprehensive understanding of a
programming language, ultimately limiting their learning"<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_6" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_6" title="View footnote.">6</a>]</sup>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Having marked over 100 student projects, I have observed many students’
progress in learning OOP and Java throughout the course. Since projects
are usually larger assignments, students will get the entire term to
work on them. But unlike a problem set with clear questions that point
you towards what concepts you should be applying, a project, self-guided
by the student, doesn’t hold this same rigor. Even though students learn
about Maps, they may just stick with two arrays, because they know how
arrays work. I will usually not see students apply many of the new
concepts they have learned in lectures. This troubles me because then
I’m not sure if they will be able to apply these concepts in higher year
courses. Another crucial concept of OOP includes Design Patterns, which
students were encouraged to implement in their projects. However, since
many students had working code without design patterns, many chose to
not try and add a design pattern to their project. However, shouldn’t
grading catch this?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But it’s also hard to grade a project, depending on how much creativity
was allowed. For some projects, like a library system, the most complex
data structure required is an array or linked list. For but a toy file
system, someone may have used an n-ary tree. But should the array user
student get a lower grade than the n-ary tree student? For CPSC 210,
this meant grading was very lax, allowing students to get very high
marks based on a very bare-bones rubric, which masked their lack of
understanding of the course content. The grading rubric was so forgiving
that projects with differing levels of complexity and concepts from
class in them were given the same mark.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I have witnessed that students enjoy CPSC 210 more than CPSC 110.
However, should student enjoyment be prioritized over knowledge
acquisition and knowledge application? Is it okay that students leave
the course with different levels of knowledge?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Project-based courses that have stricter rubrics or are "pre-designed"
by the professor seem to be able to rectify issues like inconsistent
projects between students and ensure all students are applying the same
concepts learned in the lecture. But this then removes the creativity
aspect of projects, which can make students feel the same way they did
with problem sets.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An Aside: Programming languages as vessels to teach concepts?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Something I’ve noticed in all my computer science courses is how
"programming languages are vessels to teach a concept". This means the
course doesn’t focus on all how a programming language works, the
semantics, and the rules. It seems to be the idea that students are
either able to quickly pick up the programming language or that they are
supposed to learn the programming language outside of class.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, it’s difficult for some students to understand a concept and
apply it because they have the barrier of also learning the programming
language. I nearly failed an assignment in my data structures and
algorithms course because I was having so much trouble with C++. I
didn’t understand how memory was being allocated and freed and how to
use pointers. But did this mean I understood the concepts? I’ll never
know.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For chemistry courses, we have dedicated lab instructors teaching us
laboratory concepts. But in computer science, students are left to
themselves to learn and understand a programming language. CPSC 110 had
lots of active programming in lectures and TAs who would catch people
who were just passively watching without coding on their laptops. In
other courses, the instructional team didn’t care what students were up
to during class.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Professors inevitably need to choose a programming language to use as a
vessel to teach a concept, but having to program in a new programming
language can make someone believe they aren’t understanding the
concepts, ultimately making them believe they aren’t good at CS.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Not teaching the programming language students must use can leave
students feeling like learning a new programming language is supposed to
be easy (hence no time spent on it in class) or simply cause a student
to fall behind because they don’t have the time to learn a new
programming language in addition to completing assignments.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A problem set and a project can be defined in terms of two types of
freedom. Implementation freedom, which is the "how" a program does
something, and design freedom, which is "what" a program does.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The problem-set would have little to no design freedom and any degree of
implementation freedom. Some courses emphasize only getting the right
result, meaning lots of implementation freedom, whereas other courses,
like CPSC 110, will pay attention to implementation details, so there is
less implementation freedom.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A project-style assessment has any degree of design freedom, and any
degree of implementation freedom. The implementation freedom could
depend on the design or "what" the program does.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another difference between problem sets and projects is that projects
are long-term pieces of code. How a student performs in an earlier
problem set probably doesn’t affect their performance in a later problem
set. Students can start from a "clean" slate for each problem set. But
if a student decides to poorly put together parts of their project, they
can shoot themselves in the foot if they need to understand these parts
a few weeks later, or realise later that the poorly implemented parts of
their projects are buggy. Essentially, projects also teach students how
to plan and manage code over a long period. Early computer science
students have difficultly reasoning about programs, especially in a
language like Java that has many features and confusing error messages,
which can make project-style assessments difficult, leading to the
issues mentioned above.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The distinction between a problem set and project can be blurred, but
the main difference is the potential for some more design freedom and
the long-term nature of a project.</p>

<h3 id="_how_much_design_freedom_should_be_allowed_to_avoid_issues_associated_with_problem_sets">How much design freedom should be allowed to avoid issues associated with problem sets?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Determining how much design freedom to allow is a hard question,
especially in introductory courses where there are many beginners.
Strong students probably don’t care about design freedom because they
have other factors for pursuing computer science. To have more design
freedom, I would also hope to avoid the issues with design freedom, such
as students over overcomplicating or under complicating their design, by
having more TA support. TA support could include having explicit
meetings between students and TAs. During the meetings TAs evaluate the
student’s design and be honest and knowledgeable enough to see when a
student is struggling and think of the right course of action. A way to
introduce some personalization to a problem set could to to let students
to define a part of the problem statement.</p>

<h3 id="_a_fixed_mindset_vs_growth_mindset">A Fixed mindset vs. Growth mindset</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>More difficult and abstract problem sets can be viewed as a opportunity
to learn by a strong student (growth mindset), and a challenge that will
cause struggle by a weaker student (fixed mindset)<sup class="footnote" id="_footnote_fix-grow">[<a id="_footnoteref_7" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_7" title="View footnote.">7</a>]</sup>. I
don’t think problem sets should become easier, because computer science
is about coming up with solutions around abstract problems and upper
year courses will also be difficult. It doesn’t do the student any good
to be "babied". The course cannot constantly and always provide
motivation, which means motivation and a connection to computer science
has to be provided early in the course or elsewhere, such as through
clubs or advising.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finding ways to motivate and help students in computer science courses
is a hard problem to solve and more pronounced in computer science
because students come from so many different backgrounds and have
differing levels of preexisting knowledge. This paper shows that an
educator suggests "we should not teach and assess everyone in the same
way"<sup class="footnoteref">[<a class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_7" title="View footnote.">7</a>]</sup>. Unfortunately, teaching everyone at the individual
level is impossible.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_freedom_of_designing_your_own_project">Freedom of designing your own project</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The freedom of open-ended projects is a double edged sword. When
students change their vision due to difficulties in learning a hard
concept, seeing another student be able to implement that hard concept
could be a blow to their self-esteem and interest in the subject.
Problem sets allow students to identify where they struggled, which give
them an idea on how to improve on later problem sets. However, projects
can amplify and compound a student’s struggles, as a student’s previous
code choices will impact future code choices. Students don’t properly
verify code is bug free and ensure code does what they want it to,
because it’s harder to spot mistakes with so much freedom, even for a TA
(a TA may not understand the student’s vision or misinterpret it). This
then results in a student creating a subpar project, which they then may
compare to their peers’ projects. But even in the case a student does
understand concepts and has implemented them in their project, they
might just feel "behind" because their project is simpler than their
peers’ or up to their initial vision. Due to the freedom of self-driven
projects, students create projects with differing levels of complexity,
and by comparing projects with peers, this can potentially cause some
students to feel inferior. While projects can give students a sense of
pride when they demo them to each other, they can also become points of
comparison among peers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There may also be limit to how helpful design freedom is for garnering
interest. Students start out with a "high" since they are so excited
when planning out a project, and then that "high" can drastically
decrease as they begin implementation and start facing issues. And even
worse, whatever interest the student has could decrease further when
they compare themselves to "higher-performing" students.</p>
