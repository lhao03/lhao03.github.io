<p>Are you taking IB courses? If so, don’t waste all your hard work! Now as
a second-year student at UBC, I’ll now tell you how doing IB has
impacted me and the mistakes I’ve made in choosing my courses as a
first-year student.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_introduction_to_the_ib">Introduction to the IB</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you have never heard of the IB program, here’s a brief explanation
from the Calgary Board of Education:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The IB programme is an internationally recognized enrichment option for
high school students. The program develops "internationally minded
people, who recognizing their common humanity and shared guardianship of
the planet, help to create a better and more peaceful world" (IB
mission).</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The programme encourages participation in creative and service-oriented
actions, as well as personal and academic reflection, addresses
intellectual, social, emotional and physical well-being and covers the
curriculum required by Alberta Education and the IB programme.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the IB programme, there are two levels of courses you can take:
standard level (SL) and higher level (HL). Most SL courses cover your
standard curriculum while HL courses cover some first-year university
content. You must take 3 HL courses and up to 4 and then the remaining
courses being SL courses. That is of course for full IB students - you
take 6 courses total. Of those 6 courses, you must take one language,
two sciences, literature, history, and math (at my high school). Full IB
students must also take a Theory of Knowledge Course and submit an
Extended Essay.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are also partial IB students who just take a few courses (at least
one humanity and one science/math at my high school). They do not need
to take a Theory of Knowledge Course or submit an Extended Essay.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This guide will be most aligned with students interested in computer
science! But you can general points in the <a href="#_tldr">TLDR</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I took: - Chemistry HL, English Literature HL, History HL - Physics SL,
Mandarin SL, Mathematics SL</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I’ll go into deeper detail about each course and the impact it has had
on my two years at UBC.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Courses I’m glad I took:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Chemistry HL</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>English Literature HL</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>History HL</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Theory of Knowledge</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Physics SL → I don’t regret taking Physics SL, but I would have liked to take Physics HL (however I would
take Mathematics HL over Physics HL, and that’s why Physics SL is here).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Courses I regret taking (and what I would replace them with):
* Mandarin Ab Initio → literally any other language
* Mathematics SL → Mathematics HL</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_chemistry_hl">Chemistry HL</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By taking Chemistry HL, you can fulfill the lab and science requirements
for the BSc. Additionally, if you are planning to major in life
sciences, taking Chemistry HL will help you prepare for the
university-level chemistry content, which is very different from what
you learn in high school. With my credit from Chemistry HL, I skipped
CHEM 121 and I went straight into CHEM 123, which was a breeze for me.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_english_literature_hl">English Literature HL</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For many people, English can be a demanding course, which can have the
negative effect of also lowering your GPA. If you take English
Literature HL you can skip 6 credits of the first year ENGL courses -
that’s your comminations requirement. For this meant I did not do any
ENGL courses in university!</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_history_hl">History HL</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As a BSc. student you need 12 art credits in addition to communications
courses. Since I took History HL, I got 6 credits worth of HIST courses
- that’s already half of your required arts credits!</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_physics_sl">Physics SL</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I got 3 credits for PHYS 100, but I didn’t need credits for PHYS 100. I
would have preferred not to get credit for PHYS 100, but UBC takes all
your transfer credit for IB or none. The 3 credits added towards my
total credits taken which you can read about <a href="#_overall">here</a>. If you
took Physics HL, then you would be able to replace PHYS 100 (3) and PHYS
1st-year level (3), with exemption from PHYS 101, which would also
complete your lab requirements and allow you to register for
higher-level physics courses.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_mandarin_ab_initio">Mandarin Ab Initio</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is more of a personal reason for me. I’m pretty white-washed, so I
speak Mandarin at the level of a preschooler. But the thing is, learning
Mandarin at the high school level is just really hard for me. I wish I
choose a language that used the alphabet instead, as I just couldn’t
grasp Mandarin fast enough. I still speak Mandarin at the level of a
preschooler. You don’t get any credit for taking an ab initio language.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_mathematics_sl">Mathematics SL</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is probably the course I almost wish I took at the HL level. Math
HL teaches you how to write proofs, which is something the standard high
school curriculum is missing. Knowing how to write proofs gives you a
leg up as a math or computer science student. Additionally, you can skip
MATH 100 and MATH 101, and go straight into MATH 200 and MATH 221 (for
computer science students)! But be warned that MATH HL is no easy feat.
If you decide to take MATH HL you <strong>will</strong> need to put in the work. You
don’t get any credit for taking Mathematics SL.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_theory_of_knowledge">Theory of Knowledge</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For full IB students, we are required to write a TOK Essay. You can read
about that here: <a href="http://www.howtoib.com/writing-tok-essays/" class="bare">http://www.howtoib.com/writing-tok-essays/</a>. I think TOK
essays are super interesting, and if you get above a B on your essay,
you can get transfer credit for 6 credits worth of PHIL courses. And
with those 6 credits, I was already done my arts requirements as a BSc.
student.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_overall">Overall</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Due to my choices, I took only 7 courses in my first year. But even with
such a light load, I was already done my arts requirements, lab
requirement, and communications requirements. The downside to taking IB
courses is that you can go over your credit limit(48, I think I had 47)
due to transfer credits, which means you could not be able to be
promoted to the second year. You can read more about that here:
<a href="https://science.ubc.ca/students/requirements/promotion" class="bare">https://science.ubc.ca/students/requirements/promotion</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, make sure to check your university’s policy on IB credits. UBC
allows you to use all of your IB courses for transfer credit, whereas U
of Waterloo has limits. But make sure you realize the hard work you will
have to put in if you decide to choose HL courses. You are learning
standard high school and first-year university content at the same time
that other students are learning just the standard high school content.
IB courses, whether they are SL or HL, also require IA (internal
assessments) which are research-like papers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Am I glad I took IB? Of course! If I were given the chance to do high
school again I would choose to do IB.</p>
