<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: Proximity and time based exposure notifications made sense as a way to measure exposure
risk when SARS-CoV-2 was thought to spread through respiratory droplets that quickly dropped to the
ground. This meant if you were <em>within two metres from an infected individual for less than 15
minutes</em>, or you were <em>farther than two metres from an infected individual</em> you could assume almost
no viral load was transferred to you, and thus no exposure risk. Thus, apps measured time and
distance to determine exposure risk.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, now we know SARS-CoV-2 is airborne and can linger in the air for minutes to hours and
travel farther than two metres. This means other factors, such as the infected’s quality of mask and
quality of air filtration, are key to determining how far the virus can travel and how long the
virus can linger in the air, which then determines the viral load<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_1" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_1" title="View footnote.">1</a>]</sup> that someone may have
been exposed to, aka exposure risk. A digital contact tracing app has no way of knowing the
contextual information about the environment someone is in, and thus does not have enough
information to determine exposure risk. This means it no longer makes sense to rely on a digital
contact tracing app.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_the_original_paper">The original paper</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>(Ferretti et al., 2020)<sup class="footnote" id="_footnote_original-paper">[<a id="_footnoteref_2" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_2" title="View footnote.">2</a>]</sup>
suggested the idea of digital contact tracing via a digital contact tracing app.
These were the points made as to why a digital contact tracing app
could be a tool to reduce infections during the COVID-19 pandemic:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>manual contact tracing is too slow to bring down the R value, but a digital contact tracing app that instantaneously notified a exposed person to isolate would bring down the R value. Digital contact tracing apps have had success in China and South Korea.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"There is no delay between case confirmation and notification of contacts; thus, the delay for the contact quarantine process is the period from an individual experiencing symptoms to their contacts entering quarantine. The delay between symptom development and case confirmation will decrease with faster testing protocols, and indeed could become instant if presumptive diagnosis of COVID-19 based on symptoms were accepted in high-prevalence areas." (Ferretti et al., 2020)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"If testing capacity is limited, individuals who are identified by tracing may be presumed confirmed upon onset of symptoms, because the prior probability of them being positive is higher than for the index case, accelerating the algorithm further without compromising specificity." (Ferretti et al., 2020)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"With fast enough testing, even index cases diagnosed late in infection could be traced recursively to identify recently infected individuals, both before they develop symptoms and before they transmit." (Ferretti et al., 2020)</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>This could be done quickly with an algorithm, as opposed to manual contact tracing.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>"Because time of infection is generally not known, the generation time is often approximated by the serial interval, which is defined as the time between the onset of symptoms of the source and the onset of symptoms of the recipient." (Ferretti et al., 2020)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"The app can serve as the central hub of access to all COVID-19 health services, information, and instructions, and as a mechanism to request food or medicine deliveries during self-isolation." (Ferretti et al., 2020)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In fact, Canada has their own digital contact tracing app<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_3" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_3" title="View footnote.">3</a>]</sup>.
It works as shown below:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="../../images/digital-contact-tracing/canadacovid.png" alt="canadacovid">
</div>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>When you’re near someone else with the app, both phones exchange random codes every 5 minutes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The app estimates how close app users are to one another by the strength of their Bluetooth signals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The random codes change often and can’t be used to identify you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An exposure is recorded if you’re within 2 metres of someone with COVID-19 for 15 minutes or longer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each day, your phone gets a list of the random codes of app users who have reported a diagnosis. This is only possible when connected to the
internet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If it finds a matching code on your phone, the app notifies you that you’ve been exposed. It explains what to do next.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The general idea around digital contact tracing apps is that based on some proximity and time
threshold, in Canada’s COVID-19 app this is 2 metres and 15 minutes, you will be alerted with a
notification that you were exposed to someone with COVID-19. Upon this notification, you would
quarantine to prevent infecting other people. It’s been a year since the release of Canada’s digital
tracking app, and I took a peek at the report.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Maybe you’re wondering why I’m so interested in this. Well, digital contact tracing sounded like a
super cool idea of an application of technology in public health. I was excited about the app and
downloaded it myself. Unfortunately, I’ve deleted it, and in my review of the report maybe you’ll
see why.</p>

apparently 3.64M tracked COVID-19 cases (all time) in Canada when I checked on Apr 18. This means
the app had access to around 1.6% of positive cases to determine if someone could have been exposed,

environmentally mediated transmission. Therefore, the large fraction of
traceable transmission in Singapore does not contradict the large
fraction without symptomatic exposure in Wuhan.</p>

<p>It’s understandable that Western nations assumed COVID-19 wasn’t airborne, as other
deadly illnesses like cholera and polio spread through fluids and fecal
matter. Declaring a virus is airborne is also alarming, and as a global
body, WHO may have thought it was their responsibility not to
accidentally set a false alarm. However, we now know that COVID-19 is
airborne<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_5" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_5" title="View footnote.">5</a>]</sup>.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Digital contract tracing apps which use proximity to determine exposure
reduce COVID-19 transmission into the notion that we only need to be
near sick people to get sick. When not much was known about COVID-19
transmission and it was believed to transmit through respiratory
droplets that quickly fell to the ground, this would have been a model
that made sense. But with more research highlighting evidence on
COVID-19 transmission occurring when people aren’t near each other and
that particles of up to 100 microns can stay in the air, proximity isn’t
a reliable measure for exposure and downplays how transmissible
COVID-19 is. Canada’s digital contact tracing app uses 2 metres as a
proximity measure, but you can be infected from distances much
farther<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_6" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_6" title="View footnote.">6</a>]</sup> and many factors (like masking and air filtration) play into what distance is "safe".</p>

involves a continuum of droplet sizes and an important role of the
exhaled air that carries them. Smaller airborne droplets laden with
SARS-CoV-2 may spread up to 8 metres concentrated in exhaled air from
infected individuals, even without background ventilation or airflow.
Whilst there is limited direct evidence that live SARS-CoV-2 is
significantly spread via this route, there is no direct evidence that it
is not spread this way.</p>

<p>In virology lecture we are taught that airborne particles can be
respiratory droplets or aerosolised particles. Respiratory droplets
eventually fall to the ground, while aerosolised particles can linger in
the air.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At the beginning of the pandemic, WHO made the erroneous judgement that
COVID-19 was spread through respiratory droplets that eventually fell
onto surfaces and then infect those that touch those surfaces. This
mistake led Western nations to slap a sanitizer machine at every
building entrance, increase their sanitization of desks and more surface
focused cleaning<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_8" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_8" title="View footnote.">8</a>]</sup>. On the contrary, many Asian countries
have ignored the CDC<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_9" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_9" title="View footnote.">9</a>]</sup>, acting on research
that paints COVID-19 as a much more infectious virus than WHO and
Western nations think. And it seems to have paid off.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Why did WHO decide that COVID-19 wasn’t airborne? Well, since
transmission was thought to occur through sneezes, coughs, etc, that
expel large respiratory droplets, WHO thought that these respiratory
droplets would just fall to the ground. Lots of medical experts were
making the assumption that most viruses weren’t airborne since particles
were bigger than 5 microns<sup class="footnote" id="_footnote_science-screwup-airborne">[<a id="_footnoteref_10" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_10" title="View footnote.">10</a>]</sup>.
However, maybe respiratory droplets do stay in the air longer than we thought.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There’s a history<sup class="footnoteref">[<a class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_10" title="View footnote.">10</a>]</sup> that may have been a reason
why WHO acted the way they did.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In 1934, Wells and his wife, Mildred Weeks Wells, a physician, analyzed
air samples and plotted a curve showing how the opposing forces of
gravity and evaporation acted on respiratory particles. The couple’s
calculations made it possible to predict the time it would take a
particle of a given size to travel from someone’s mouth to the ground.
According to them, particles bigger than 100 microns sank within
seconds. Smaller particles stayed in the air. Randall paused at the
curve they’d drawn. To her, it seemed to foreshadow the idea of a
droplet-aerosol dichotomy, but one that should have pivoted around 100
microns, not 5.</p>

<p>Part of medical rhetoric is understanding why certain ideas take hold
and others don’t. So as spring turned to summer, Randall started to
investigate how Wells’ contemporaries perceived him. That’s how she
found the writings of Alexander Langmuir, the influential chief
epidemiologist of the newly established CDC. Like his peers, Langmuir
had been brought up in the Gospel of Personal Cleanliness, an obsession
that made handwashing the bedrock of US public health policy. He seemed
to view Wells’ ideas about airborne transmission as retrograde, seeing
in them a slide back toward an ancient, irrational terror of bad air—the
"miasma theory" that had prevailed for centuries. Langmuir dismissed
them as little more than "interesting theoretical points."</p>

<p>And then after Langmuir disparaged Well’s work he came up with this:</p>

<div class="quoteblock">

<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the report, Langmuir cited a few studies from the 1940s looking at
the health hazards of working in mines and factories, which showed the
mucus of the nose and throat to be exceptionally good at filtering out
particles bigger than 5 microns. The smaller ones, however, could slip
deep into the lungs and cause irreversible damage. If someone wanted to
turn a rare and nasty pathogen into a potent agent of mass infection,
Langmuir wrote, the thing to do would be to formulate it into a liquid
that could be aerosolized into particles smaller than 5 microns, small
enough to bypass the body’s main defenses. Curious indeed. Randall made
a note.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Langmuir did eventually shift his tone and accept that airborne
infection was possible. After Well’s died, Langmuir delivered a speech
stating "problematic particles—the ones they had to worry about—were
smaller than 5 micronsall<sup class="footnoteref">[<a class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_10" title="View footnote.">10</a>]</sup>." And that screw up started it .
However, particles that are up to 100 microns are also airborne!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While most viruses are 0.1 to 0.5 microns, viruses hitch a ride on the
droplets that we produce when breathing, sneezing or coughing. From this
experiment<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_11" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_11" title="View footnote.">11</a>]</sup> there are droplets that measure at below or
around 100 microns. This means someone’s sneeze can travel around a

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Okay, that was a lot of reading. I wanted to set up why the virus being
airborne is important and how digital contact tracing misses on this.
Digital contact tracing apps seems like a fun algorithmic problem to
determine who’s been near whom! Which is just another complex public
health and social problem reduced into a algorithm. It seemed perfect.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But the app is missing a lot of context. For one, depending on whether
or not the air is actively being filtered, being 6 ft (or 2 metres) may
be enough distance, or it might not be. And depending on one’s mask,
this further complicates what distance and time you can inhale infected
air is "safe" from being exposed to infection, The app simply doesn’t
know, and giving erroneous information is worse than no information. The
app doesn’t know anything about the quality of the air. Distance doesn’t
matter so much if the air is being constantly filtered. A CO2 monitor
would be more helpful than an app that tells me if I’ve been near a sick
person. Basically, the app totally simplifies and neglects how air
transmission works. The only way you can tell if you’ve been exposed is
if you have a CO2 monitor telling you if the air is being recirculated and
  whether it is being filtered enough such that you aren’t breathing in the air other people exhale.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Since COVID-19 virus is airborne, one should assume no distance and time
near infected air is safe, unless they had data to tell them otherwise.
For instance, it would be useful to know if I was in a restaurant or
building that had bad air quality. Much of the public has no access to
knowledge of whether their air is being filtered or not, or the quality
of the filter. If we aren’t able to access high quality, real time data
on positive cases, understanding our air quality is the next best piece
of data we can use to make informed choices.</p>

<h3 id="_to_get_infected_viruses_require_affinity_and_avidity_with_the_human_receptor">To get infected, viruses require affinity and avidity with the human receptor.</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There’s a lot of chemistry, physics and biology involved in getting
infected. First, the physics of viruses. Viruses spread through surface,
liquid and air. The physics for each medium is different, and it’s
important we all have some basic understanding of how to prevent
transmission given the medium of spread.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To become infected, viruses require affinity and avidity. What does this mean? Well it’s
time for chemistry. Affinity is how strongly two molecules will react
with each other. We can think of this as the binding event between the
virus and human receptor. The stronger the binding event, the better.
More specifically if the virus has more affinity to bind than the native
molecule that usually binds to the human receptor, then the virus is on
its first step to infecting us. Next, we must have avidity, which is the
accumulated strength of multiple
affinities<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_13" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_13" title="View footnote.">13</a>]</sup>.
Affinity isn’t always enough, thus, if there’s more virus than native
molecule, the higher concentration of virus can out compete the native
molecule. Once some threshold is met, you are infected.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And the biology is how our body responds. Our immune tries it’s best to prevent
the virus from damaging our body, but COVID-19 can cause "collateral tissue
damage and systemic failure"<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_15" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_15" title="View footnote.">15</a>]</sup>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Okay, so what does this mean? There are some things we can’t control, like how a
virus spreads or which human receptor the virus will bind to and how strongly
that virus will bind. But there are some things we can control, like avidity
(how many virus particles) and our immune response. We can control our avidity
to a virus by wearing high quality masks and requesting better air filtration or
choosing to increase access to outdoor air. We can control our immune response
by getting vaccines.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Unfortunately, education on proper masks has been non-existent, with
some health leaders suggesting that cloth masks are still okay to wear
(they aren’t<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_16" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_16" title="View footnote.">16</a>]</sup>).</p>

<p>Much of the success of the app relies on quickly and accurately

limits who can get tested.</p>

<h3 id="_viruses_mutate_at_random_a_lot">Viruses mutate at random. A lot.</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But viruses don’t mutate everywhere at random. We’ve observed with
COVID-19 variants and other coronaviruses that there are some conserved
regions that undergo mutation a lot less. For instance, the residues of
the substrate-binding pocket are highly conserved<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_17" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_17" title="View footnote.">17</a>]</sup> and don’t really undergo much
mutation, since this protein is essential to replication and proteolytic
processing.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But the spike protein on the other hand goes through a lot of mutation.
For instance, many Omicron’s
mutations<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_18" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_18" title="View footnote.">18</a>]</sup> are associated with the ACE2 receptor binding and
antibody binding sites (our vaccines currently target these proteins).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Mutations are random, but the random mutations that survive
current drugs and vaccines are the mutations that will continue to
spread. Mutations that occur on proteins like the main protease may also
occur, but some mutations are more deadly to the virus than others, and
these mutated viruses simply cease to replicate, ending their ability to
spread.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With that being said, for current drugs and vaccines to continue
working, we have to slow down the chance for the virus mutate. The
likelihood of mutation increases as more and more people become
infected. This means we must prevent infection.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>People will argue that infection is mild, but getting infected isn’t
just about getting infected. It’s about whether you become the new
reservoir to the next COVID-19 variant.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Digital contact tracing apps can give someone an over simplified model
of how COVID-19 transmits; using proximity doesn’t make much sense since
the virus can stick around in the air and viral load is dependent on a
lot of factors like masking and air filtration. The longer
and more we get infected, the more variants there will be. It’s time to
ditch the app and go back to tracking data and using methods like
masking and air filtration; methods that work.</p>

<p>Obviously, that sort of adoption has not happened in Canada and probably
will not. Only 15-20% of the Canada’s population has installed the app.
If we play with some simulations here and assume 20% of Canadians will
self-isolate, maybe assuming 20% of infections will be stopped, this is
still not enough to move COVID-19 into endemic phase. This
analysis<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_19" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_19" title="View footnote.">19</a>]</sup> done quite early during

<p>access to lots of quick and accurate tests</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a preventative mindset towards being exposed, as outlined in the paper:
"If testing capacity is limited, individuals who are identified by

</li>
<li>
<p>ability for people to upload self confirmed tests to the app</p>

<li>
<p>adoption of the app by 60%<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_20" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_20" title="View footnote.">20</a>]</sup> of the population</p>

<li>
<p>people to actually self-isolate until they are no longer sick</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a better way to measure exposure risk: using masking and air filtration to predict
exposure risk or understanding that the virus can linger in the air, so
letting users know if they have been in the same location as someone who
was infected, regardless of how far or how long they were near that
infected individual</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>However</em>, to prevent new variants and prevent long COVID I believe we
must work towards no infections at all, not just reducing infections. I
understand this is a more extreme stance, but drug and vaccine
development simply will always lag behind the virus, and developing
drugs and vaccines isn’t easy! Since 100% (or even 50%) adoption and
<strong>use</strong> of the app isn’t feasible, I don’t think digital contact tracing
works in a Western society.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It’s not worth the time and money to keep trying to use digital contact
