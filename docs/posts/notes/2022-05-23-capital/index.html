<p>Bourdieu argued that a fundamental part of what it means to be human was our struggle to acquire symbolic capital [51]: i.e., our effort to gain recognition from people who belong to a group we admire and respect.</p>

* which means that many instructors lack formal training in education and basic knowledge of learning theories.
* Since the instructors‚Äô background in technical education does not prepare them for teaching, they lack training in diversity-conscious pedagogy and critical understanding of how learning communities, regardless of their formal or informal nature, are transmitters of the dominant culture. Foor et al. [37] argues that a first step for educators to change this dominant culture is to examine the underlying beliefs of the CS culture and how they impact learners.</p>
