<blockquote>
<p>“I had a sense of not being quite integrated, my self was missing because I could not identify with [them]… [I was] a different sort of being, not quite of the same species. [I saw this] as a lack in myself” (Lugones 1990 p. 393).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The experiences I had are shared by many others (e.g. female students) who do not feel at home in the discipline, and, just as Maria Lugones writes, might see this as a lack in themselves. These experiences and feelings of ‘outsiderness’ are driving forces for making the discipline more inclusive, so that different ways of ‘being’ are accepted. [p20]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When I started my research, my thinking was (implicitly) dominated by the idea of defining a problem and then finding a way to resolve it. This is fundamentally and deeply rooted within the engineer, although it is seldom articulated and made visible. I was trained to delimit a problem, make it as simple as possible, and then apply the most straightforward solution. This is an approach where logical and abstract thinking are emphasised. Within CS, I was further trained in the use of algorithmic approaches to problem solving. This tends to encourage linear thinking about problems. Thus, my education and professional life had trained me in a certain way of thinking and approaching problems. [21]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>My argument for focusing on this ‘paradigmatic basis’ of computer science was that issues concerning CS itself and its knowledge processes were for the most part absent in research and discussions on gender and CS. [21]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The process of blackboxing is equivalent to the process of naturalisation, in which something (an artefact, an idea, a concept, etc.) is stripped of its origins, context and consequences and is regarded as given, as self-evident. [22]</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>knowledge is intertwined with communication and language.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>“The field of computer science education research has a cross-disciplinary structure, and encompasses computer science – of course – but also a wide range of other disciplines: pedagogy, psychology, cognitive science, learning technology, sociology to mention a few. What unifies this diversified field is the aim to improve learning and teaching within computer science, and thereby to contribute to computer science.” (Ibid p. 23).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Since technology is seen as neutral, this stance has not seldom led to seeing women as the problem: women should be informed / educated / adapted to technology: “Women shall be enticed into existing practice and adapt to it.” (Trojer 1999, p. 13). With this view, it is mainly women who are expected to change. [26]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There is also a tendency within liberal feminism to treat men and women as homogeneous groups, ignoring diff erences between individuals, as well as for example ethnicity and class. In practice, liberal feminist projects have had very little impact on the gender balance within technology or computer science; in fact this approach can be seen as
reproducing and reinforcing the status quo. [26]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Feminist studies of technology can to a large extent be regarded as part of the STS tradition, in that the starting point and approach can be summarised as the social construction / shaping of technology. According to Vehviläinen (2001) this approach sees technology as a process consisting of three interrelated parts: artefacts, knowledge and social practices. [28]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>However, as Wajcman (1991) notes, there are fundamental differences between (natural) science and technology: technology needs to be understood as more than applied science, since it is primarily about the creation of artefacts (ibid p.13).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Around this time, a shift towards understanding technology as culture became more apparent. According to this view, both gender and technology can be understood not as fixed and given, but as processes, which are constantly being formed and re-formed in ongoing negotiations in relation to each other. [28]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Henwood provides a good historical overview of how computing changed from a woman’s job to one occupied mainly by men, which she sees as linked to changing definitions of skill. [28]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Technology meanings are not ‘given’, they are made. … We should be focused on that knowledge … we have to be involved at the level of definition, of making meanings and in creating technological culture.” (Ibid p. 44).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>As pointed out by Grint and Gill (1995), the idea that technology and masculinity are intimately related seems to be accepted by most feminist writers within this tradition, who rather than challenging this idea try to understand why this is the case. [29]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>One example of such a pervasive idea is that men are interested in technology per se, while women are interested in what it can be used for. [29]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Observations are theory-laden, theories are paradigm-laden, and paradigms are culture laden: hence there are and can be no such things as value-neutral, objective facts.” (Harding 1986, p.102).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>An example of a methodology is, in my opinion, the importance stressed within feminist research of placing the researcher in the same plane as the researched, which puts the entire research process (not only the research object) under scrutiny (Harding 1987). Th e researcher is not a neutral, invisible, anonymous person, but a visible, situated person with specific interests and behaviour who becomes part of the whole process. Th is approach can be called reflexivity, and I will discuss it in more detail below. This kind of methodology also follows explicitly from the epistemological positioning. [35]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Feminism is not a dogma but a set of critical questions [37]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Diff raction is a metaphor for another
kind of critical consciousness … one committed to making a diff erence […] So I use
it to talk about making a diff erence in the world, as opposed to just being endlessly
self-refl ective.” (Haraway 2000, pp. 101f., 104). [38]</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As engineer, this type of critical reflexivity is not part of my repertoire […]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“The reality is that the “doing” of science is, at its best, a gripping and fully absorbing activity…. The net result is that scientists are probably less reflective of the “tacit assumptions” that guide their reasoning than any other intellectuals of the modern age. […] Indeed, the success of their enterprise does not, at least in the short run, seem to require reflexivity. Some would even argue that very success demands abstaining from reflection upon matters that do
not lend themselves to “clear and distinct” answers”. (Fox Keller 1992, p. 27) [51]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The reality of engineering work today is a fragmented process, “in which most engineers occupy specialist roles, where reductionism is acceptable, while only a few ever occupy heterogeneous roles, where holism is necessary” [51]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>She argues that postmodernism, and in particular poststructuralism, by its insistence, indeed requirement, of recognising the knower as situated, actually frees the writer to explore new ways of knowing. Writing, according to Richardson, is not only the common academic form of reporting on one’s findings, but also a method of inquiry, as well as a method of knowing. [52]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>experimental ones such as “narrative of the self”, in which the writer can write in a personalised way, telling stories about her or his lived experiences (Richardson 1994, p. 521). This form of writing can be used to “say what might be unsayable in other circumstances” (ibid, p. 521). [52]</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="paper-a2">Paper A2</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>I would characterize these projects, these interventions, as targeting equality issues,
and in fact, creating exclusions, instead of inclusions (singling out female students in
the gender segregated teaching project for instance). [74]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>During my work with these projects, I gradually started questioning these “women- into-technology”-oriented approaches, realising that the equality project is not enough. [74]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>What are the challenging boundaries involved in my work? One of them concerns epistemologies, where the feminist epistemologies that are foundational for me, such as situated knowledge and partial perspectives, and thus also the world-view, is completely different from most of the epistemological foundations of CS. There are also questions of definitions: such as what is considered to be CS, which in turn create inclusions and exclusions: who is considered to have valid CS knowledge? [74]</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is a general belief in rather clear and simple solutions and at the same time that changes are necessary in society. It seems there is a willingness to accept the need for revolutionary changes in society, culture and attitudes, but not when it comes to one’s own discipline, where more surface-oriented solutions are suggested.

<p>“The nature of the computing discipline itself needs to be addressed by its participants: what is computing science? This need is slowly being recognised but the variety of answers reflects the problem” (Stack 1997 p. IX)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“We have educated thousands of developers, engineers, and researchers who see their roles as technology inventors, and only a few who start by understanding situations and people and let that drive the creation of technologies. By presenting the major challenges of computing as technical challenges, we have lost the interest of many brilliant technical minds – often female – because their interest is in using that brilliance to solve real problems rather than creating technology for technology’s sake.” (Borg 2001 p. 141)

<li>too little communication with research and knowledge acquired within other disciplines</li>
<li>unwillingness to question the discipline itself and its practices</li>
<li>problem has been constructed in a way to limit the solutions</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Social Scientists</strong> [97]
- focus on “gender and CS”
- early research appraochs problem on individual level: “that changes within CS may offer women a unique opportunity because changes in the mental model of computing will make it more ‘feminine’, or that object-oriented programming would require a reconsideration of traditional concepts of masculinity and femininity”
- Sherry Turkle:
- soft mastery: more interactive approach to computer as tool and co-operative behaviour
- hard mastery: control over machine and competitive behaviour
- neither style superior for programming but computer expertise is defined in terms of hard mastery</p>
<ul>
<li>social constructivist approach: historical and cultural contexts are dominant factors behind under-representation of women in computing</li>
<li>Judy Wajcman: argues against Turkle’s view
<ul>
<li>cognition can not be stripped of its social content to reveal pure logical reasoning”</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>“It was because programming was initially viewed as tedious clerical work of low status that it was assigned to women. As the complex skills and value of programming were increasingly recognized, it came to be considered creative, intellectual and demanding ‘men’s work’. Thus, depending on the circumstances, different cognitive styles may be characterized as ‘masculine’ or ‘feminine’ according to the power and status that attaches”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“The culture and ideas of a small male minority of students, the computer hackers, come to dominate computer science in the eyes of the female students. This minority culture is reinforced by the values and interests of the most powerful (male) groups in computer science, the male professors and teachers, and their disciples, the dedicated students. In this way, a male-dominated and machine-fixated culture works to marginalize women” (Rasmussen and Hapnes 1991, p 1107).</p>

<li>a need to understand how discipline of computing is constituted historically
<ul>
<li>Clegg: Computing was institutionalised alongside other male-dominated disciplines, establishing itself as intellectually challenging, tough and abstract. She claims that computing is neither an extension of mathematical thinking nor an applied science.</li>
<li>computing is concrete (rather than abstract) science with materiality and social practice [100]</li>

<li>Linda Stepulevage and Sarah Plumeridge: ow certain dogmas of science, such as physics as the paradigm of science, and ‘pure mathematics’ as value-free, are relevant to computer science.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>“Computer science as the pure focuses on understanding the world via a rationality based in the abstract; therefore, the concrete products resulting from the discovery and development of algorithms can exist outside the domain of computer science and there is no need for critical self-reflection” (Ibid p. 316-317).</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>solely focussing on social aspects like history ad culture other factors may be overlooked.</li>

<p><strong>Cross- and Interdisciplinary Groups and Forums</strong>
&gt; “the decline in the number of young women selecting computer science majors was attributable to a male-oriented paradigm in computer science” [101]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“the decline in young women…can be attributed to the existing educational paradigm that separates studies of science, math, and computer science from studies of the humanities” (Ibid p. 1), and she advocates a more integrated approach. Thus, she focuses on the structural level combined with the symbolic level. [101]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>She argued for a new approach in the introductory course, using application software packages instead of procedural programming. This would give students immediate success in doing something useful, while still illustrating and reinforcing CS concepts. This is an example of an intervention at the structural level. [101]
- similar to the idea of HtDW and having images be easily rendered in BSL
- also issue of “black box” of APIs</p>

<ul>
<li>two different styles of programming: [101]

<li>no difference in end product, just process
<ul>
<li>planners: at a distance, bricolage: closeness to the objects of work</li>
</ul></li>
<li>most men are planners, most women prefer bricolage =&gt; different attitudes towards knowledge</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The emerging object-oriented approach is seen as potentially revolutionary: “first, within the world of programming through legitimising alternative methods; second, in the larger intellectual culture, by supporting trends in cognitive theory that challenge the traditional canon”</p>

<li>at CMU: “Women in Computer Sciences: Closing the Gender Gap in Higher Education”</li>
<li>do women approach the study of computer science differently from men?”</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Students’ understanding (both intellectual and social) of the nature of the field is a key concept, but women often and the area too narrow, they feel they have to be too narrowly focused (Fisher et al 1997).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“The computer science culture assumes that men will succeed. […] Hence it bolsters men’s confidence and sense of belonging. This same culture does not assume (often accurately) that women conform; hence they enjoy no default expectation of success, and their interests and attachments to computing may be regarded as deviant from the norm, and less serious than those of the male students”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The aim of the group has been to broaden the culture and curriculum, to show that there are multiple ways to be a computer scientist and to be interested in the subject, and to demonstrate that valuable contributions to the field come from people with different sets of attachment to computers (Margolis et al 2000). Among examples of the changes that they have implemented are: different entry points to the curriculum, depending on the level of experience, an “immigration course” to expose new students to a wide variety of CS issues and applications in order to counteract the “all programming” stereotype, and interdisciplinary courses. The project has been a success, with an increase in female enrolment in the computer science programme from 7% in 1995 to 42% in 2000 (Margolis, Fisher 2002).</p>
