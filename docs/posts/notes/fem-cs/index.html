<blockquote>
<p>“I had a sense of not being quite integrated, my self was missing because I could not identify with [them]… [I was] a different sort of being, not quite of the same species. [I saw this] as a lack in myself” (Lugones 1990 p. 393).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The experiences I had are shared by many others (e.g. female students) who do not feel at home in the discipline, and, just as Maria Lugones writes, might see this as a lack in themselves. These experiences and feelings of ‘outsiderness’ are driving forces for making the discipline more inclusive, so that different ways of ‘being’ are accepted. [p20]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When I started my research, my thinking was (implicitly) dominated by the idea of defining a problem and then finding a way to resolve it. This is fundamentally and deeply rooted within the engineer, although it is seldom articulated and made visible. I was trained to delimit a problem, make it as simple as possible, and then apply the most straightforward solution. This is an approach where logical and abstract thinking are emphasised. Within CS, I was further trained in the use of algorithmic approaches to problem solving. This tends to encourage linear thinking about problems. Thus, my education and professional life had trained me in a certain way of thinking and approaching problems. [21]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>My argument for focusing on this ‘paradigmatic basis’ of computer science was that issues concerning CS itself and its knowledge processes were for the most part absent in research and discussions on gender and CS. [21]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The process of blackboxing is equivalent to the process of naturalisation, in which something (an artefact, an idea, a concept, etc.) is stripped of its origins, context and consequences and is regarded as given, as self-evident. [22]</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>knowledge is intertwined with communication and language.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>“The field of computer science education research has a cross-disciplinary structure, and encompasses computer science – of course – but also a wide range of other disciplines: pedagogy, psychology, cognitive science, learning technology, sociology to mention a few. What unifies this diversified field is the aim to improve learning and teaching within computer science, and thereby to contribute to computer science.” (Ibid p. 23).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Since technology is seen as neutral, this stance has not seldom led to seeing women as the problem: women should be informed / educated / adapted to technology: “Women shall be enticed into existing practice and adapt to it.” (Trojer 1999, p. 13). With this view, it is mainly women who are expected to change. [26]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There is also a tendency within liberal feminism to treat men and women as homogeneous groups, ignoring diff erences between individuals, as well as for example ethnicity and class. In practice, liberal feminist projects have had very little impact on the gender balance within technology or computer science; in fact this approach can be seen as
reproducing and reinforcing the status quo. [26]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Feminist studies of technology can to a large extent be regarded as part of the STS tradition, in that the starting point and approach can be summarised as the social construction / shaping of technology. According to Vehviläinen (2001) this approach sees technology as a process consisting of three interrelated parts: artefacts, knowledge and social practices. [28]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>However, as Wajcman (1991) notes, there are fundamental differences between (natural) science and technology: technology needs to be understood as more than applied science, since it is primarily about the creation of artefacts (ibid p.13).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Around this time, a shift towards understanding technology as culture became more apparent. According to this view, both gender and technology can be understood not as fixed and given, but as processes, which are constantly being formed and re-formed in ongoing negotiations in relation to each other. [28]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Henwood provides a good historical overview of how computing changed from a woman’s job to one occupied mainly by men, which she sees as linked to changing definitions of skill. [28]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Technology meanings are not ‘given’, they are made. … We should be focused on that knowledge … we have to be involved at the level of definition, of making meanings and in creating technological culture.” (Ibid p. 44).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>As pointed out by Grint and Gill (1995), the idea that technology and masculinity are intimately related seems to be accepted by most feminist writers within this tradition, who rather than challenging this idea try to understand why this is the case. [29]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>One example of such a pervasive idea is that men are interested in technology per se, while women are interested in what it can be used for. [29]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Observations are theory-laden, theories are paradigm-laden, and paradigms are culture laden: hence there are and can be no such things as value-neutral, objective facts.” (Harding 1986, p.102).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>An example of a methodology is, in my opinion, the importance stressed within feminist research of placing the researcher in the same plane as the researched, which puts the entire research process (not only the research object) under scrutiny (Harding 1987). Th e researcher is not a neutral, invisible, anonymous person, but a visible, situated person with specific interests and behaviour who becomes part of the whole process. Th is approach can be called reflexivity, and I will discuss it in more detail below. This kind of methodology also follows explicitly from the epistemological positioning. [35]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Feminism is not a dogma but a set of critical questions [37]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Diff raction is a metaphor for another
kind of critical consciousness … one committed to making a diff erence […] So I use
it to talk about making a diff erence in the world, as opposed to just being endlessly
self-refl ective.” (Haraway 2000, pp. 101f., 104). [38]</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As engineer, this type of critical reflexivity is not part of my repertoire […]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“The reality is that the “doing” of science is, at its best, a gripping and fully absorbing activity…. The net result is that scientists are probably less reflective of the “tacit assumptions” that guide their reasoning than any other intellectuals of the modern age. […] Indeed, the success of their enterprise does not, at least in the short run, seem to require reflexivity. Some would even argue that very success demands abstaining from reflection upon matters that do
not lend themselves to “clear and distinct” answers”. (Fox Keller 1992, p. 27) [51]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The reality of engineering work today is a fragmented process, “in which most engineers occupy specialist roles, where reductionism is acceptable, while only a few ever occupy heterogeneous roles, where holism is necessary” [51]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>She argues that postmodernism, and in particular poststructuralism, by its insistence, indeed requirement, of recognising the knower as situated, actually frees the writer to explore new ways of knowing. Writing, according to Richardson, is not only the common academic form of reporting on one’s findings, but also a method of inquiry, as well as a method of knowing. [52]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>experimental ones such as “narrative of the self”, in which the writer can write in a personalised way, telling stories about her or his lived experiences (Richardson 1994, p. 521). This form of writing can be used to “say what might be unsayable in other circumstances” (ibid, p. 521). [52]</p>
