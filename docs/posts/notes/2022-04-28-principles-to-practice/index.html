<div class="paragraph">
<p>I talked about I noticed students were struggling with the project based
nature of
<a href="how-to-teach-cs-courses/#project-based-courses">CPSC 210</a> and how I was worried that students were leaving the course without
a good understanding of OOP. Then I realized maybe the problem isn’t
just that the course is project based, but that students may be having a
hard time transitioning from CPSC 110 (functional programming in BSL and
ASL) to CPSC 210 (OOP in Java).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In fact, I TAed CPSC 210 and remember a student who frequently came to
me to review questions they got wrong on midterms. The student was a
hard worker, but just couldn’t wrap their head around OOP. I then took a
break from CPSC 210 to TA CPSC 110 and was surprised to see the same
student as a TA for CPSC 110! That got me thinking, this student must
have done well in CPSC 110 to be TAing the course, but why did they
struggle in CPSC 210?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I was came across Matthias Felleisen’s
<a href="https://felleisen.org/matthias/Thoughts/Developing_Developers.html">Developing
Developers</a> and saw some researchers had the same observation that I did
about students having confusion when transitioning from functional
programming to OOP, and they came up with a solution: another course to
bridge between functional programming and OOP.</p>
