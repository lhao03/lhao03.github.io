<ul>
<li>CS Unplugged: introduce functional cs principles in active learning activates without use of computers</li>
<li>results were at odds with the enthusiasm</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="introduction">introduction</h1>
<ul>
<li>outreach program, CS Unplugged, consists of set of modules that introduce fundamental cs principles through hands-on activities.</li>
<li>program distinguished by two characteristics:
<ul>
<li>activities are designed to be completed without computers
<ul>
<li>instead complete kinesthetic tasks</li>
</ul></li>
<li>activities are designed to support adaptation to suit a range of learning levels; instructors can reveal more detail as appropriate</li>
</ul></li>
<li>program at high school consisted of ten 40-minute sessions repeated for two semesters in an introductory programming course</li>
<li>evaluation objectives:
<ul>
<li>evaluate impact of program on student attitudes towards computer science</li>
<li>impact of program on students’ perceived content understanding</li>
</ul></li>
<li>however, program had no statistically impact in either evaluation objectives (with one exception)
<ul>
<li>some students attitudes moved in undesirable direction</li>
</ul></li>
<li>there are CS Unplugged activities in ACM K-12 Model Curriculums, so it’s important to understand how CS Unplugged succeeds and fails</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="related-work">related work</h1>
<ul>
<li>Heersink and Moskal surveyed high school students on attitudes towards “computer science” and “information technology”
<ul>
<li>students could not distinguish between the two</li>
<li>attitude this confusion to broad use of educators who are both computer science and information technology teachers</li>
</ul></li>
<li>CS Unplugged was also introduced to younger children, middle school and grade 4, with positive impact on student interest in cs in middle school children.
<ul>
<li>grade 4 children didn’t like the binary activity</li>
</ul></li>
<li>CS4HS: emphasize how cs and cs careers are more than just programming</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="program-design">program design</h1>
<ul>
<li>lesson 1: binary numbers
<ul>
<li>convert between number systems</li>
<li>learn why binary is necessary</li>
</ul></li>
<li>lesson 2: anatomy of a computer
<ul>
<li>disassembly and reassemble computers</li>
</ul></li>
<li>lesson 3: information theory</li>
<li>lesson 4: algorithms and sorting
<ul>
<li>discuss two sorting algorithms</li>
<li>ask students to sort themselves</li>
</ul></li>
<li>lesson 5: sorting networks and parallel computing</li>
<li>lesson 6: graphs and mst
<ul>
<li>model airport routes and interstate maps as graphs</li>
<li>prim’s algorithm in game</li>
</ul></li>
<li>lesson 7: routing and deadlock</li>
<li>lesson 8: error detection and cryptography</li>
<li>lesson 9: public key encryption</li>
<li>lesson 10: programming languages

<li>blindfolded robot sent through maze based on tasks</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="pilot-program">pilot program</h1>
<p>semester 1
- gains in interest and content understanding were insignificant
- added accountability to program to ensure students were accountable for the lesson content</p>
<p>semester 2
- control group of semester 1 became experimental group of semester 2
- had to do worksheet after each lesson</p>
<h1 id="evaluation">evaluation</h1>
<ul>
<li>survey results indicated little to no change in interest/content confidence</li>
<li>only question with significant change: I think I could explain what an “algorithm” is.
<ul>
<li>thought because algorithm was introduced early on and talked about in later modules</li>
</ul></li>
<li>more significant increase in interest from groups that didn’t have much interest in the first place</li>
<li>for students who were interested in cs before doing CS Unplugged, they gave lower ratings in post survey compared to their pre servery
<ul>
<li>their interest still remained high though</li>
</ul></li>
<li>compared to control, there was no significant interest/confidence gain or gap closure among two experimental groups, and in many cases, the results were negative, especially among mid and high groups</li>
<li>students seemed to learn cs and computer engineering were two different disciplines</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>free response question 1: what topics/courses do you expect to study in university if you pursued a CS degree?</strong>
experimental groups
- robotics, computer science, binary numbers, networking were four new topics in post survey =&gt; these topics were covered in the modules
- from both groups, students seemed to believe that computer programming was important to study in computer science
- surprising because they weren’t using computers and computer programming was never mentioned</p>
<p>control group
- thought that taking computer programming classes is not as important as they stated in their pre survey</p>
<p><strong>free response question 2: which high school classes would be important to prepare you for a CS degree in university</strong>
experimental groups
- post survey, both groups thought the webpage design course was not as important as previously thought
- drew stronger connection between CS and math
- differs from control group</p>
<p>both groups
- <strong>control group drew stronger connection with cs and programming, experimental group drew stronger connection cs and math</strong></p>
<h1 id="discussion">discussion</h1>
<p>reasons for, on average, no impact on student attitudes to cs or their perceived content understanding:
- high school students don’t find kinesthetic activities as exciting as younger children
- students were less motivated to participate than the researchers hoped
- students who were already in a cs programming class were thought to be students who would be interested in CS Unplugged
- however, after reviewing data, these students seemed to perceive themselves as “experienced programmers”, and so have less interest in learning these concepts
- other interactions of CS Unplugged were deployed at summer programs or after school programs, in which participants were self selected with strong pre-existing interest
- kinda contradicts the students with high interest who had interest go down based on this experiment</p>
<h1 id="my-thoughts">my thoughts</h1>
<ul>
<li>students in a cs programming course may already know a bit about the lessons presented, so it makes sense their interest doesn’t change</li>
<li>we shouldn’t focus on increasing interest of students already interested, I word like to see this experiment conducted again on students <strong>not</strong> in a cs programming course.
<ul>
<li>but doing so would be hard, because would these modules take time from another class? be after school?</li>
<li>maybe as part of the “Science 10” unit, which comprises of a bit from biology, physics and chemistry at the moment</li>
</ul></li>
<li>the association of cs with math from the experimental groups is interesting, and I think a positive outcome, because students complain that CS degrees are too math and theory heavy because of incorrect assumptions that cs is only programming.</li>
