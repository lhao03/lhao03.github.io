<div class="paragraph">
<p>As computer science becomes more and more popular, middle school and high
school curriculums are changing to capture the skill of computing. In fact,
<a href="../../../posts/notes/2022-06-11/ab-cs">Alberta’s curriculum</a> added some computing
to it. I wrote down a summary <a href="../../../posts/notes/2022-06-11-ab-cs">here</a>.
I imagine there are many reasons why computer science is being added to the
K-12 curriculum. Some reasons include:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="../../../images/bootstrap/ab-cs.png" alt="ab cs">
</div>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>this notion of "transfer learning", that computational thinking can help students think in other areas</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>preparing students for jobs in tech</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>computing thought of as a essential skill for the future</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Regardless of the reason that computing is being adding to the K-12 curriculum,
the way we deliver this content is important.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In Professor Shriram’s talk, he mentioned four methods that computer science could be delivered to
students. These include making computer science a <em>required course</em>, an <em>elective
course</em>, an <em>after school program</em>, or to <em>integrate into an already required
course</em>. I’ll briefly list the pros and cons of each method. Bootstrap’s three
core goals are <strong>rigor</strong>, <strong>scale</strong>, and <strong>equity</strong>,
which I also agree with them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the university setting, these goals are far easier to achieve than in the high school
or middle school setting. In the university setting, courses are expected to uphold
some standard of rigour. This rigour includes factors like what other
higher-level courses expect from lower-level courses, what students want out of
the course, etc. Scale is also easier to achieve, because of highly
specialized professors at <em>most</em> universities [though this may not be the exact
reason] as well as resources that allow for scalability (like educational technology and teaching assistants).
And finally equity, which means ensuring anyone who wants to take a course, can
take it. Usually in university, most students come from a privileged
background, and have foundational courses they took in high school. Most first
year university students can take the introductory level of computer science.
Additionally, students in university are free to "choose" their own schedule,
so they can choose to take a 3 hours of lecture everyday, or 6 hours.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But at the K-12 setting, rigour, scale and equity is more difficult to achieve,
and often one or more of these goals suffer.</p>

<p>making a course required means rigour may have to suffer to ensure everyone can pass the course (if the course is required you have to make it simple enough that majority can pass)</p>

<li>
<p>since the course is required, everyone will be exposed to it, which ensures equity</p>

<p>not every school can offer a computer science elective, most likely the case will be that schools in privledged areas serving white/Asian students will be able to offer a computer science elective</p>
