I’m not gonna talk about medical stuff related to after care, but rather choosing where to get your ear pierced and why to even get your ear pierced in the first place. Read at your own risk and remember these thoughts and tips are written by me for someone like me! So they may not work for you.

<h2 id="_why">why?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>what’s your why for getting ear piercings? do you like the look? do you like changing up your earrings? do you wanna wear more than one earring at a time? or do you want to stand out? are getting piercings a form of self expression?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>as a person who grew up around chinese ideals, piercings, other than on your ear lobes, are usually not really desirable. this may be changing (due to kpop, anime, etc) but generally it’s kind of frowned upon. as of writing this my parents do not know of my new piercings. do i care what my parents think? for some things yes. about my ear piercings? no.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_should_i">should i?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>one thing i tend to overlook or get excited and forget about is that getting the piercing is actually the easy part, caring for it is hard. are you able to care for your piercing? can you refrain from touching it? are you able to only sleep on one side? are you ready to invest money into things like a reputable piercer, good quality jewelry or a piercing pillow?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>piercings, like bleaching your hair, is actually quite a high maintenance thing, at first. it depends on where you get your piercing. obviously there are many different types of piercings, so make sure you sit down and figure out if a certain piercing will work with your life style and ask all the questions you have about caring for it with your piercer.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>also side note: seeing all those cute pictures of ear piercings on IG with those cute earrings? well you’re going to need to wait 6 - 12 months before you can attempt to put in fashion jewelry into your (cartilage) piercings.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There’s alot of activities or objects on your face that you should consider before getting your ears pierced. For the most part, the lobe piercing is the least problematic piercing to get and interferes the least with the points mentioned below.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_glasses">glasses</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Glasses will interfere with piercings that are close to the arms of the glasses, a front helix or helix close to the front can make your piercing angry. I knew this could an issue so I opted to choose an piercing location that was away from my glasses.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_mask">mask</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The same issue with glasses, it can interfere with more outer ear piercings.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_wireless_bluetooth_ear_buds">wireless bluetooth ear buds</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These can interfere with more inner ear piercings. If you wanna get an inner ear piercing you shouldn’t be wearing any ear buds, and probably go for headphones.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_sleeping">sleeping</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Sleeping on your lobes is usually ok after a few weeks. But a BIG NO NO for cartilage piercings. If you are a side sleeper and want to get cartilage piercings, get the piercing on the side of your head that you don’t sleep on.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_hair_salon_anything_that_involves_interacting_with_your_head">hair salon, anything that involves interacting with your head</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I dyed my hair a weekish before getting my ears pierced and I’m really glad I did. When the hair dresser is cutting, dying, blow drying, washing, etc your hair you ears will get touched, and that can really irritate your ears.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You also shouldn’t get any hair treatment immediately getting your ears pierced.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_hair">hair</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you have long hair, tuck your hair behind your ear, or have hair in general, it can get caught in your earrings, so keep that in mind.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_cost">cost</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Be prepared to spend $100+ to get pierced by a reputable piercer and to have good quality jewelry. Generally, piercers have offered me implant grade titanium (I’ve always chosen titanium) or solid gold.</p>

<p>pros
* slightly lower so less chance i comb my hair and get it caught
* can wear earbuds</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I chose the lower helix since I value wearing earbuds alot. I also am able to sleep on one side, so I don’t think sleeping would be a big issue for me.</p>

<h2 id="_lobe_vs_cartilage">lobe vs cartilage</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Lobes are a great starter piercing and are the ones most people will get at first. Painwise, lobes don’t even hurt (if you get pierced using a needle). If you get pierced using a gun that can kinda hurt (avoid piercing guns like the plague).</p>
