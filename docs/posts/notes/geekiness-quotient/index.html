<li>Geek Gene Hypothesis: two types of CS students, based on innate ability. Those who can learn and those who can’t</li>
<li>Folk Pedagogy: teacher’s understanding of students’ minds and how they learn
<ul>
<li>teaching …is based on notions about the learner’s mind. Beliefs and assumptions about teaching …are a direct reflection of t he beliefs and assumptions the teacher holds about the learner.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>what are educators’ views of the geek gene?</li>
<li>what are the implications of those beliefs?</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="background">2 background</h1>
<ul>
<li>two groups of students: bimodal grade distribution</li>
<li>predictive factors: successful programmers “tend to have pre-existing strengths in a strategic / algorithmic style of articulation.”</li>
<li>fixed/growth mindsets: can be applied to students and instructors
<ul>
<li>believing in geek gene is equivalent to having fixed mindset</li>
</ul></li>
<li>learning/student behaviour: more effort usually led to higher grades</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="results">4 results</h1>
<ul>
<li>two groups of students:
<ul>
<li>split between the instructors</li>
<li>reaching out to students who aren’t the best seen as “dumbing it down”</li>
<li>when the phrase “geek gene” was mentioned explicitly, it was viewed as bad belief</li>
<li>when mentioned implicitly “only some students are good at computer science” it was in agreement of existence of the geek gene</li>
</ul></li>
<li>predictive factors:
<ul>
<li>some instructors saw mathematics ability as important</li>
<li>some thought math courses or math-based examples drove people away</li>
<li>liking to solve problems, attention to detail, formal notation, technically orientated</li>
</ul></li>
<li>fixed/growth mindsets:
<ul>
<li>growth mindset viewed positively</li>
</ul></li>
<li>student behaviours:
<ul>
<li>importance of practice, learning from failure, hard work, persistence</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>In working with a computer, she is necessarily embracing logical–mathematical abilities to a far greater extent than do most individuals in most other societies.
- intellectual profiles affect the processes that go on to when we try to understand, explain, interact and express.
- mismatch between intellectual profiles would reduce the likelihood for common understanding
One universal problem in CS Education is the students’ highly varying backgrounds in CS, and identical goals set by the educational system, which means that their learning journeys are different.
In this environment, the idea of “the geek gene” is a convenient explanation (excuse) for why so many fail and why it is a bad idea to spend time on the ones that do not have the gene.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="conclusions-and-implications">6 conclusions and implications</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>A fixed mindset provides a reason to give up on apparently weak students and even actively weed them out, a tendency now reinforced by the high enrollments in CS courses.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Given a good teacher, any student will improve
if they are willing to work. The idea of a ”Geek
Gene” provides a convenient excuse for giving up
on struggling students.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For me, this doesn’t make it any easier to counsel students who are struggling in early CS courses. …. I’ve had the gratifying experience of encouraging students who doubted their abilities, and eventually watching them succeed in computer
science. I’ve also had the experience of encouraging students who eventually gave up after years of frustration. I’m not sure I did a service to the latter group.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>is it in an instructors best interest to encourage students to continue?</li>
