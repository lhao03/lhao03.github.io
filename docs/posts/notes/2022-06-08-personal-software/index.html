<p>I’ve seen on Twitter lot’s of thoughts about making "personalized" software, one being this idea of "tools for thought". There are lot’s of tools, like "tools for thought" (I think the name sounds a bit weird, but I digress), that help you to personalize your notes the way you want to. But I’ve never felt a desire to use such a tool, no matter how fancy or fast it is. No matter, what, nothing will beat hand written notes and my actual physical brain.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I’ve seen some of these tools where it allows you to "put links" between notes, like how your brain puts links between them. But it just seems a bit unnatural to me. If anything, I don’t really want to explicitly make connections between my notes, but rather have connections be made implicitiy. I usually make connections between notes when I’m writing a blog post, or just thinking (meaning I’m away from my laptop). In the first scenario, 99% of the time I remember the note’s title or contents, and I just use <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep">ripgrep</a> to search my notes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another thing is that all these fancy tools require like buttons and clicking and "looking". There’s a lot of senses required, I think too much. I honestly can’t believe I haven’t started using the terminal before my computer science major. The terminal is declarative, and one command usually gets the job done.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Anyways, I just don’t think many software tools can replace something that was never "computer-based" to begin with, like thinking and making connections between thoughts.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I’ve also seen this idea of "personal computer" and "local-first". I’m not entirely sure what it means, but there’s already been many software tools that are easily configuarbale, open sourced, and not tied to any company. For operating systems, there’s obviously Linux. If you’re a noob like me, you can go with Ubuntu or Fedora, and just personlize the "look" of the kernal. And then you can literally build your own OS from source with Arch or Gentoo. For text editors, there’s Vim and Emacs. Emacs org-mode for instance, I’ve heard is used by many researchers. I think there’s already been lot’s of work done on personal and local software that personalizes tools that are mostly "computer-based" in the first place.</p>
