<div class="ulist">
<ul>

<p>SICP: frees the course from revolving around the syntax of the language, allowing the course to present deep concepts in computing such as FP, higher-order functions, data abstracttion, data-directed programming, streams, message passing, logic programming, interpreters, register machines</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>If teachers don’t state such principles explicitly,6 the first program- ming course turns into a course on syntax, no matter how simple the underlying programming language. In our experience, implicit learning does not work well for the majority of students. Most students are not the type of learner who can extract abstract principles on program design from a series of examples. As a matter of fact, across the spectrum of universities that the authors represent, most students simply are not prepared to abstract anything from a series of exer- cises. Instead students focus on the surface level of knowledge in such a course, which is the syntax of the programming language. Worse, they think that this fo- cus on syntax is natural and accept it as a key insight for future learning efforts concerning computing and programming.</p>
