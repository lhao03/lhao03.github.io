<p>Because the
compiler determines what \v means, the compiler cannot translate \v until \v has
first been specified in a machine code version of the compiler. However, producing
that machine code version of the compiler requires first having a working specifica-
tion of \v.
The solution to this problem is mundane: the code must be changed to define \v
in reference to a lower-­level standard:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>if (c == ‘v’)
return(11);</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Why 11? This is the number (arbitrarily) given to vertical tab in ASCII, the encod-
ing used on most computers for representing the Latin character set.17 The compiler
produced using this code now correctly parses \v as vertical tab, at least so long as it
is run on a system that uses the ASCII character set.
Note that the compiler produced through this process now accepts the original
definition of \v, the one that the previous version of the compiler flagged as an
error. Once you have compiled one version of the source code containing the “magic
number” 11 for vertical tab, you can change the code back to:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>if (c == ‘v’)
return (‘\v’);</p>
