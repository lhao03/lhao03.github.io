<div class="paragraph">
<p>as I found the two activities harder and harder to
combine, I had to make up my mind, either to stop programming and become
a real, respectable theoretical physicist, or to carry my study of
physics to a formal completion only, with a minimum of effort, and to
become‚Ä¶, yes what? A programmer?</p>

<p>automatic computers were here to stay, that we were
just at the beginning and could not I be one of the persons called to
make programming a respectable discipline in the years to come?</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But most important of all, the programmer himself had
a very modest view of his own work: his work derived all its
significance from the existence of that wonderful machine. Because that
was a unique machine, he knew only too well that his programs had only
local significance and also, because it was patently obvious that this
machine would have a limited lifetime, he knew that very little of his
work would have a lasting value.</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Firstly, we have got the I/O interrupts, occurring at
unpredictable and irreproducible moments; compared with the old
sequential machine that pretended to be a fully deterministic automaton,
this has been a dramatic change and many a systems programmer‚Äôs grey
hair bears witness to the fact that we should not talk lightly about the
logical problems created by that feature.</p>
</div>

<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>as the power of available machines grew by a factor of
more than a thousand, society‚Äôs ambition to apply these machines grew in
proportion, and it was the poor programmer who found his job in this
exploded field of tension between ends and means.</p>

<p>Besides that, LISP has been the carrier for a
considerable number of in a sense our most sophisticated computer
applications. LISP has jokingly been described as ‚Äúthe most intelligent
way to misuse a computer''. I think that description a great compliment
because it transmits the full flavour of liberation: it has assisted a
number of our most gifted fellow humans in thinking previously
impossible thoughts.</p>

<p>If you want more effective programmers, you will
discover that they should not waste their time debugging, they should
not introduce the bugs to start with.</p>

<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If software development were to continue to be the
same clumsy and expensive process as it is now, things would get
completely out of balance. You cannot expect society to accept this, and
therefore we must learn to program an order of magnitude more
effectively. To put it in another way: as long as machines were the
largest item on the budget, the programming profession could get away
with its clumsy techniques, but that umbrella will fold rapidly.</p>

<p>But: program testing can be a very effective way to show the presence of bugs, but is hopelessly inadequate for showing their absence.</p>
