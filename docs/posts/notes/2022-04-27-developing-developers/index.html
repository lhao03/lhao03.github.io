<div class="paragraph">
<p>Instead of the currently fashionable programming
language, it focuses on explicit and systematic approaches to program
design. To bring this idea across to the full range of Northeastern
freshmen, the first course uses a simple teaching language that is
tailored to our goals. Follow-up courses explain how to apply the design
principles to industrial programming languages, how they enable logical
reasoning about code, and why they matter when programmers deal with
large and complex software.</p>

<p>In sum, traditional programming courses teach
programming implicitly, with students picking it up via mimicking and

the same extent from a properly taught course on programming and problem
solving.</p>

<p>I liked reading the rationale for how UBC’s CS courses are structured.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>as a first year student, I didn’t really understand why UBC was using
BSL and had a large focus on functional programming, while UoT and UofC
used Python. Now I’m really glad I was introduced to the "trinity"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think the connection between CPSC 110 and CPSC 210 isn’t that
<em>clear</em>? While TAing CPSC 210, many students didn’t really apply the
knowledge from CPSC 110 (like design recipes). It was more of "mimic
and learn implicitly".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CPSC 310 seems to be the Software Development course. But students are
restricted to using TS and no hard deadlines, so not much code
revisiting occurs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think CPSC 213 (ironically) does a better job of incorporating in
CPSC 110 content like design recipes</p>
