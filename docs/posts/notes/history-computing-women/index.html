workers as much as by an assumption of skilllessness, subclerical work
increasingly became seen as ideal for young women in the twentieth
century.</p>

a total reliance on women trainees from then on. […] therefore that
women were as of now "eligible equally with men for all the training,"

<p>men and machines formed an unstoppable cybernetic system […] In reality,
this relationship was far less neat and far more mediated by layers of
communication and data-processing. Given that these young women had
family and friends in the line of fire, the idiosyncracies of their
machines were as frightening as they were frustrating. In the opinion of
leading Post Office engineer Tommy Flowers, the only way to speed the
pace of codebreaking further—and enhance accuracy—was to use an
all-electronic computer.</p>
