<h2 id="_my_issues_with_handwriting_notes">My issues with handwriting notes</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I have a problem with note-taking. For as long as I can remember, by the
time I reached the end of the semester, there are papers all over my
desk; some useless, some useful. I also have a bad habit of using scrap
paper for problem-solving, whether it be for MATH 200 or CPSC 320, but
sometimes I do actually write down something insightful. But since it‚Äôs
scrap, I end up either losing that piece of paper or throwing it away
üòÖ.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For my note-heavy classes, like biochemistry or microbiology, I went
through notebooks so fast that I would have to carry 3 notebooks per
class in my backpack. And sometimes I‚Äôd need to remind myself of this
concept from 4 months ago, which meant spending a few minutes flipping
through several notebooks, in hopes of finding that half-page of notes
in 300 pages.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And lastly, when I take notes in class there are a few other smaller and
random issues:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>I sometimes bring quest ionable pens to write with.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And then I make mistakes. I could use a pencil, but I don‚Äôt like how it
rubs off. This means I use white-out to correct myself, or even worse, I
rip off a piece of paper, and tape it over my mistake. Which then makes
my notes ugly, which makes me not want to read them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I don‚Äôt want to ruin my notes by writing down in class problems to solve. In my computer
science and math classes, it‚Äôs common that we solve some problems in
class. But since I don‚Äôt know how much space I need to think and write
out my solution, it results in some ugly notes, because if I leave
myself not enough space, then I‚Äôm writing all over the margins of my
notes. If I leave too much, it‚Äôs just unused space.</p>
</li>
</ul>

looked at these notes after I wrote them because they are kinda ugly.</p>

<h2 id="_why_not_type_up_notes">Why not type up notes?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I‚Äôve only typed out notes for two classes: History IBHL and MICB 201.
But when I type up notes, I don‚Äôt feel like I retain anything. When I
type notes, its more so that I can quickly search through them. This is
useful for brute memorization courses in which I would search up a piece
of information (like when the Sino-Soviet split occurred or the
difference between gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria). For other
courses like math, computer science, or chemistry, or less
memory-intensive courses, typed up notes weren‚Äôt that useful because I
liked to draw out things and drawing out things with a keyboard or mouse
wasn‚Äôt appealing to me.</p>

<p>I think the iPad is great for people who handwrite their notes or like
writing down their ideas. It is a must for me to write down my ideas,
especially for chemistry and low-level computing, because I cannot just
think there and think of a chemical reaction, I need to try different
pathways.</p>
