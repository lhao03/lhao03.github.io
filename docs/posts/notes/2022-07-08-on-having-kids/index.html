    <div class="paragraph">
<p>if you are able to bear children, then at least one time in your life, someone has assumed or stated that you will have kids. it’s something i think about maybe once a week or once a month, but it’s a thought that’s becoming more reoccuring. in the more recent years, there have been many events that have greatly influenced my decisions towards having kids.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>first one is how my body could change with pregnancy. throughout my childhood and into my young adulthood, i’ve struggled with an eating disorder and body disphormia. in all honesty, i’m not sure if i could handle how my body would change after pregnancy. i know other’s who have been pregnant have gotten back to their so called "pre-pregnancy body" but there’s always the possibility you never get back to a body you like; there might be "imperfections" that stay on your body and would have not been there if you were never pregnant. i don’t know if that’s something i can live with without being triggered by my body dismorphia.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>next is the question of when to have kids. maybe one reason i’m scared to have kids is how my career would be impacted. i feel guilty that my birth very possibly derailed both my parents careers. my brother even further derailing my mother’s career. it seems like there is no right time to have kids and any time is as bad (or good) as the other. i also can’t stop myself from thinking about what would it be like if my parents could pursue their dreams, or something closer to what they wanted to do with their lives. as with many immigrants, my parents had to work extra hard to to reach the same level of status as those who were citiens of usa/canada. my mom’s college degree was "invalid" in the western world, despite having also taught high school and university level mathematics in china. my dad had to do another master’s degree in the usa, after the one he did in china, (i think he might have 3 masters degrees), before doing his phd. and even then, their job hunt in the usa as students with visas proved difficult, difficult enough that our small family moved to canada. the western world is harsh towards people having kids unless you have a bunch of extended family and heaps of money to hire help. my parents didn’t have that, and sacrificed the advancement of their careers to have kids.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>the third reason is that the world is just kind of shit right now. the world has always been shit, and will be shit.</p>
