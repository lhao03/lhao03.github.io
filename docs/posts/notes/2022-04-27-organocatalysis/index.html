</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>prediction tasks (taken directly from the paper)
- Despite the diverse structural features embedded in target molecules, is it possible to predict the enantioselectivity of key steps toward their synthesis?
- If so, can this be applied toward both complex scaffolds and single-molecule targets?
- Finally, when different catalysts and reactions can be utilized to generate the same products, can statistical models allow the selection of the best synthetic route?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>three literature reactions that produced functionalized indole structures from enamine and in situ-generated iminiums</p></li>
<li><p>goal: exrapolate to new reaction types that provide varying levels of enantioselectivity, catalyst was highly represented in training set but iminium and enamine was not.</p>
<ul>
<li>hmm</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>model highlights iminium, nucleophile and catalyst as important contributors to enantioselectivity, required steps for ee (enantiomeric excess) prediction are:</p>
<ul>
<li>locate ground state of these reactions by DFT (density functional theory)</li>
<li>obtain relevent model descriptors shown</li>
<li>submit to mathematical equation</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>model captures that 2-naphthyl-derived chiral phosphates will provide excellent levels of enantioselectivity even though training reactions emphasze importance of large catalyst groups for high ee.</p>
<ul>
<li>model clearly explains why these substrates work well with less bulky catalysts</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>most significant contrast between target reaction and similar reactions: both nucleophile and iminium have large steric profiles.</p>
<ul>
<li>suggests matching a bulky nucleophile and iminium produces enhanced repulsive interactions with catalyst substituents in the TS leading to competing enantiomer.
<ul>
<li>high enantioselectivities can be obtained with smaller catalysts when they are paired with large reactants</li>
</ul></li>
<li>expanded to transformations catalyzed by secondary amines.
<ul>
<li>model describes reaction between aldehydes and reactants that proceed via chiral iminium/enamine intermediates.</li>
<li>these reactions undergo formation of stereocenters implanted within common functional groups =&gt; these functional groups can undergo changes for product diversity =&gt; can model predict this step</li>
<li>because there is a lot of important structural motifs</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>model did well on amination reaction that was well represented</p></li>
<li><p>challenged the model to predict enantioselectivity of alkenylation and Friedel-Crafts reactions</p>
<ul>
<li>model correctly predicted an alkenylation reactions that combine copper and secondary amine catalyst</li>
<li>model can also effectively predict enantioselectivity outcome of Diels-Alder cyclization cascade even though this wasn‚Äôt represented in training set.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>model predicted using secondary amine catalyst would result in higher ee compared with chiral phosphate catalyst (consistent with experiment)</p>
<ul>
<li>model also suggests the choice is not critical since both catalysts show relatively high performance
<ul>
<li>other factors like cost or accessibility could lead in choosing a catalyst</li>
</ul></li>
