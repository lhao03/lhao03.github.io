<p>I grew up right when social media was just starting to exist. I had to
fight my dad to get an email and didn’t even do anything with the email
once I got it. Computers were not part of my life like reading books
was. I didn’t notice or care about computers. I wasn’t that kid who
took apart computers for fun.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I felt neutral at best towards computers. Something like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
More and more students use a computer in their daily lives but have
little to no understanding of the inner workings of computers, models of
computation, or computer programs. Using a computer is like riding the
bus; it’s just how life is. You may use Google Docs because your school
requires you to. Ignoring the capitalistic argument for pursuing
computer science, I don’t think many students are passionate or enjoy
learning about computer science solely to just learn how a computer
works. Rather, students want to learn about the vocational skills
associated with computer science, while ignoring the theory. That may be
because the link between computer science and society, or the impacts of
computer science (besides Big Tech and AI, where there’s a lot of money
involved) is hard to see.

<p>The computer wasn’t seen as something I could pick apart and understand like chemistry. While I could pick apart the world with chemistry, I didn’t know what skills and knowledge I needed to pick apart a computer. K-12 schools also didn’t put emphasis on "the computer" but only "using the computer".</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While CS education in post-secondary was growing and shaping a powerful new industry, CS education in K-12 schools was ultimately conflated with education technology (using computers to learn) and digital literacy (learning to use computers). Thus, the modern ideas of CS, while shaping government, business, and higher education across the world throughout the 20th century, failed to shape primary and secondary education in meaningful ways.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These visions imagined that simply by placing computers in school, learning would happen automatically, without any structure or guidance. This same basic narrative of computers as a path to liberation spread far beyond the United States, with many influential CS leaders attempting to spread computers to the global south, and largely failing, as there was once again no vision for how the computer would be used.</p>

computers as magical. But they aren’t as magical as they seem. Did you
know the first computer included wood parts and always broke? Computers

<h2 id="_what_a_is_computer">What a is computer?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I think computers are perhaps a combination of mathematics, physics, and
chemistry.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_mathematics">Mathematics</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Computers do computing (obviously).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>What’s computing?</strong><br>
Computing is the act of performing mathematical or procedural tasks. You
don’t need code to compute; all humans can compute!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Computing is already taught as basic mathematical skills, like learning
your time’s tables and doing calculations by hand. In university, you
then learn it again when you learn about binary and hexadecimal.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Computing also involves the application of algorithms. How would you
introduce an algorithm without code? It can be as simple as telling a
group of students to sort themselves (based on height) using a sorting
algorithm like bubble sort or merge sort. Then you can ask the students
their observations on the different algorithms.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A computer seems like it’s just doing magic, but it’s computing. The
first computers were people (mostly women) during WWII, where they
calculated the correct coordinates for projectiles. The abacus can also
be seen as a computer, one of the first computing tools created by
humans.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Many emerging curriculums seem to be focusing a lot on teaching
computing. If you want to learn more about computing, I recommend
watching videos from Simon Peyton Jones<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_1" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_1" title="View footnote.">1</a>]</sup>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Computers do millions of mathematical operations a second to display
pictures on your screen and interpret signals from your keyboard. Humans
have placed a lot of trust in computers being correct when doing math.
And this trust has led to catastrophe<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_2" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_2" title="View footnote.">2</a>]</sup>. With the
increasing use of computers to do calculations for us, it is imperative
to teach students that computers are finite while mathematics is
infinite. A computer is a handy machine, but that piece of metal cannot
store all digits of pi. When dealing with irrational numbers, computers
must always round. When you’re finding the area of a circle for math
class, rounding errors are almost negligible, but for space operations,
these errors can be much more catastrophic.</p>

<h3 id="_chemistry_todo">Chemistry [todo]</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Chemistry because of the special qualities of metals, rare earth metals,
and silicon makes these elements the perfect medium for computing, as
well as oxidation and reduction reactions that make batteries work.</p>

<h2 id="_how_does_a_computer_work">How does a computer work?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Even in my university classes, many students don’t recognize that
someone, human, like us, designed the computer the way it is today. The
use of QWERTY keywords isn’t a phenomenon like gravity, it was a design
choice. Someone is making these choices, and we should learn about these
choices because there can be small and large consequences if we don’t.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Obviously, computers are elegant, complex and sometimes (but mostly
always) confusing to understand. But there are 4 "parts" that when put
together, allows a computer to work.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Operating System</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>File System</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Memory</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Programming Languages</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_you_better_trust_your_operating_system">You better trust your operating system!</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The computer’s operating system is it’s control center, a collaboration
between software and hardware. Every program, except the operating
system itself (which is also a program) is managed by the operating
system. A computer has limited memory, and every program wants that
memory! The computer also can’t do everything at once. How does a
computer make sure each program gets to run and that each program gets
the memory it needs? The operating system. The operating system is also
like a security guard; it makes sure the memory given to a program is
memory that program is allowed to either read, write or execute. When
memory runs out, which it will, it is up to the operating system to
choose which program loses it’s memory to give to the other programs.The
operating system also ensures programs don’t use each other’s memory or
try to steal teach other’s information.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But operating systems weren’t always made up of metal and circuits.
Operating systems were human! Humans would sit in giant rooms and enter
in programs and make sure programs had enough memory to run and didn’t
access the information or memory of another program. Obviously, humans
sleep, so that meant a computer wasn’t able to run all day. Eventually,
human operators were replaced with the operating systems we use today,
such as MacOS, Windows and Linux.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A human operator probably couldn’t and wouldn’t try to read the data
associated with a program. But since modern operating systems are fast
to use, companies can easily add in tracking devices to monitor what
goes on in your operating system, in addition to forcing you to use
certain types of software (cough cough Microsoft).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The operating system you are using today not only determines how fast
your applications are or how many you can open at once but also which
tech company you’re giving your personal information to. Companies want
your data and people should understand what this means.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_a_misunderstandinglack_of_understanding_of_a_file_system">A misunderstanding/lack of understanding of a file system</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As a Teaching Assistant, something I was surprised to see was how
unfamiliar students were with their file system. When I was evaluating
final projects in CPSC 210, I would try to run a program, only to see an
error saying that a necessary file was missing. When I approached the
student about the error, many would show me their program working
perfectly fine on their computer.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What happened was that the student was not checking if the project files
were the same on their local machine and GitHub. Since I don’t have
access to their local machine, I would retrieve the code from GitHub and
run it on my machine. However, some files would still be on their
computer, usually in the Downloads folder. Since the Downloads folder
was not part of their git<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_3" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_3" title="View footnote.">3</a>]</sup>-tracked
directories (essentially, git was not checking the Downloads folder to
see if a new file was added), students would tell me "git didn’t tell
me to commit this file". Other similar issues involved the file
existing on a student’s Desktop folder, which was also not tracked by
git. Another related issue included the use of hard links like
"/usr/lucy/myproject/code.java", which only exists on Lucy’s computer,
not Bob’s. All these mistakes involve a misunderstanding or lack of
understanding of how a file system works.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When I ask a student to find their project on their file system, many
times, students respond with "what’s the file system" or tell me they
have no idea where their project is. Honestly, the first few times I
received questions like these I was surprised, but then I started to
wonder why students were so unfamiliar with their file system. Even with
personal computers becoming more and more common, there are a growing
number of students who don’t understand or misunderstand how a file
system
works<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_4" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_4" title="View footnote.">4</a>]</sup>. I believe that if students were taught about how a computer
manages files, which is similar but also different from how a librarian
manages books, as part of their elementary or secondary education, I’d
be receiving a lot fewer questions about file systems.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_how_memory_works_in_progress">How memory works [in progress]</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another concept that I also recently learned was about how a computer
writes data. When you delete a file or an important pdf, you would
probably think it’s gone from your computer. However, in most cases,
your deleted file is still there, until it gets overwritten. All your
computer does is keep track of memory that has information the user
thinks is important, like a file that they saved. When a user deletes a
file, the computer simply marks the area in memory, and information
encoded by that memory, as information the user doesn’t care about
anymore. When you save a new file, the computer will overwrite that area
in memory.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This means after you throw away your computer, you could still have
important information on you computer that you meant to delete from the
world! Someone could mount your file system and gain access to sensitive
information. Again, this would have been something students should learn
about.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="../../images/computers/data.jpg" alt="data">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Learning about computers should be part of standard education because
computers are everywhere and used by most people who have no idea how a
computer works. Education should not purely serve to equip a group of
people with skills for a career. Education is to help people understand
the world around them. This is why we learn science in elementary
school. While one can get through the world without understanding
Newton’s Laws, acid and base theory, and cell biology, it can deepen
your understanding of the world. When computers were only for government
officials and university professors, it would have been pointless to
teach the general public about computers. But now knowledge of computers
should be taught to everyone.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_programming_or_talking_to_your_computer">Programming, or talking to your computer?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Last but not least, is programming languages. A programming language
such as C will compile down into byte code that your computer then runs
on. There’s a lot of programming languages, and each programming
language has its place. Some programming languages like C and Rust are
fast, so they are used in applications that we want to be really fast,
like an operating system or video game. But C has it’s own
disadvantages, such as lack of many safety checks, which leads to many
bugs like integer overflow. Other programming languages like Haskell are
typed, meaning they use type systems to ensure code conforms to certain
rules, kind of like a contract. Critical applications like banking
applications might choose Haskell to ensure safety, while sacrificing
speed.</p>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_what_are_the_ethics_and_history_of_computers">What are the ethics and history of computers?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There’s a bunch of origin theories on how eukaryotic cells evolved from
a symbiotic association of prokaryotes. But computers don’t have any
origin theories because computers were invented and created by many
humans for many reasons! While we have no clear idea of how cells gained
mitochondria, we do know computers were made by many humans, with their
own goals and aspirations for what a computer should be. Babbage wanted
to create a computer to replace human workers, while Lovelace and Turing
were simply passionate about the mathematics and logic behind computers.
The idea of replacing human workers with computers persists even
stronger today.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Critically Conscious Computing<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_5" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_5" title="View footnote.">5</a>]</sup> gives
an overview of the ethics and history of computing, whether it
be how algorithms can oppress, or how the first computers and operating
systems came about. Design Justice<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_6" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_6" title="View footnote.">6</a>]</sup> also gives insight into how choices can harm individuals, and
lastly, Programmed Inequality<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_7" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_7" title="View footnote.">7</a>]</sup> discusses
how women helped create the field
of computing and computers, only to be forgotten as computing turned
into a male dominated field. These books and their authors explain the
area of ethics and history much better than I can in a blog post. I
highly recommend you read their works.</p>
