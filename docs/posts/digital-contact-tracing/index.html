<p><em>I welcome thoughts and critique on this post. Contact me via Twitter or
email.</em> <em>Need to add proper citations. A work in progress.</em></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: Proximity and time based exposure notifications made sense as a
way to measure exposure risk when SARS-CoV-2 was thought to spread
through respiratory droplets that quickly dropped to the ground.
Essentially, when SARS-CoV-2 was never even thought to be airborne. This
would mean if you were <em>within two metres from an infected individual
for less than 15 minutes</em>, or you were <em>farther than two metres from an
infected individual</em> you could assume almost no viral load was
transferred to you, and thus no exposure risk. Apps were designed to
measure these two metrics.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, now we know SARS-CoV-2 is airborne and can linger in the air
for minutes to hours and travel farther than two metres. Thus means
other factors, like the infected’s quality of mask and quality air
filtration/circulation, are key to determining how far the virus can
travel and how long the virus can linger in the air, which then
determines the viral load<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_1" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_1" title="View footnote.">1</a>]</sup> that someone may have been exposed to, aka exposure risk. Therefore, a digital contact
tracing app has no way of determining the context of the environment
someone is in, and thus does not have enough information to determine
exposure risk. This means it no longer makes sense to rely on a digital
contact tracing app.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_the_original_paper">The original paper</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A paper<sup class="footnote" id="_footnote_original-paper">[<a id="_footnoteref_2" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_2" title="View footnote.">2</a>]</sup>
suggested the idea of digital contact tracing (via a digital contact tracing app).
These where the points made as to why a digital contact tracing app
could be a tool to reduce infections during the COVID-19 pandemic:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>manual contact tracing is too slow to bring down the R value, but a
digital contact tracing app that instantaneously notified a exposed
person to isolate would bring down the R value.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"There is no delay between case confirmation and notification of contacts; thus, the delay
for the contact quarantine process is the period from an individual
experiencing symptoms to their contacts entering quarantine. The delay
between symptom development and case confirmation will decrease with
faster testing protocols, and indeed could become instant if presumptive
diagnosis of COVID-19 based on symptoms were accepted in high-prevalence
areas."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"If testing capacity is limited, individuals who are
identified by tracing may be presumed confirmed upon onset of symptoms,
because the prior probability of them being positive is higher than for
the index case, accelerating the algorithm further without compromising
specificity."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"With fast enough testing, even index cases diagnosed
late in infection could be traced recursively to identify recently
infected individuals, both before they develop symptoms and before they
transmit."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This could be done quickly with an algorithm, as opposed to manual contact tracing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"Because time of infection is generally not known, the generation time is often approximated by the serial
interval, which is defined as the time between the onset of symptoms of
the source and the onset of symptoms of the recipient."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>digital contact tracing apps have had success in China and South Korea.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"The app can serve as the central hub of access to all COVID-19 health
services, information, and instructions, and as a mechanism to request
food or medicine deliveries during self-isolation."</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In fact, Canada has their own digital contact tracing app<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_3" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_3" title="View footnote.">3</a>]</sup>.
It works as shown below:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="../../images/digital-contact-tracing/canadacovid.png" alt="canadacovid">
</div>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>When you’re near someone else with the app, both phones exchange random codes every 5 minutes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The app estimates how close app users are to one another by the strength of their Bluetooth signals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The random codes change often and can’t be used to identify you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An exposure is recorded if you’re within 2 metres of someone with COVID-19 for 15 minutes or longer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each day, your phone gets a list of the random codes of app users who have reported a diagnosis. This is only possible when connected to the
internet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If it finds a matching code on your phone, the app notifies you that you’ve been exposed. It explains what to do next.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The general idea around digital contact tracing apps is that based on
some proximity and time threshold, in Canada’s COVID-19 app this is 2
metres and 15 minutes, you will be alerted with a notification that you
were exposed to someone with COVID-19. Upon this notification, you would
quarantine to prevent infecting other people. It’s been a year since the
release of Canada’s digital tracking app, and I took a peek at the
report.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Maybe you’re wondering why I’m so interested in this. Well, digital
contact tracing sounded like a super cool idea of an application of
technology in public health. I was excited about the app and downloaded
it myself. Unfortunately, I’ve deleted it, and in my review of the
report maybe you’ll see why.</p>

<p>The Canadian government came out with a report<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_4" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_4" title="View footnote.">4</a>]</sup> reviewing
the impact Canada’s digital tracking app on the pandemic. Here are my
thoughts <em>in italic</em>. When I say <code>council</code> I mean <code>COVID-19 Exposure
Notification App Advisory Council</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>COVID Alert has been downloaded over 6 million times, and 20,000 people
have since entered a one-time key (OTK) following a positive COVID-19
test result, notifying other users that they may have been exposed to
the virus.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>As of Feb 2022, there have been 6,893,423 downloads and 57,704 keys
used. With a population of around 38 millions, this means only 15-20% of
the population has downloaded the app. There are apparently 3.64M
tracked COVID-19 cases (all time) in Canada when I checked on Apr 18.
This means the app had access to around 1.6% of positive cases to
determine if someone could have been exposed, and then alert them. Such
a low number of reported cases means this app is a inaccurate tool for
someone to use as a judgement to whether they have been exposed or not.</em></p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>COVID Alert is a national exposure notification app that will alert
users if they have been in close contact with other users who have
tested positive for COVID-19.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Getting only reports for "close contact" gives the impression that
you can only get sick from being "close" to someone. This is
incorrect, since researchers have discovered cases in which no one was a
close contact with each other, yet still people were becoming infected.
You <strong>can</strong> get sick <strong>without</strong> being near someone who is sick.</em></p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Although individuals experiencing these barriers are unable to use the
app directly, they can still benefit from it if other people use it. For
example, if someone with the app receives a notification, they may
decide not to visit a medically vulnerable person. This action protects
the vulnerable person from potential exposure, even if the vulnerable
person does not have their own compatible phone.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Much of the app is based on voluntary action. The phrase "may decide"
is used, and this makes it seem as if vulnerable people are at the mercy
of those who have the latest technology and can use the digital contact
tracing app. We can’t assume people will act with the best intentions,
and certainly cannot just leave vulnerable folks at the hands of
able-bodied and privileged people. The report also implies that it’s
okay to exclude vulnerable individuals from this tool. Everyone deserves
access to data and information to protect themselves.</em></p>

<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Currently, British Columbia, Alberta, Nunavut and the Yukon have not
adopted the COVID Alert app.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>If nearly all of Western Canada isn’t able to use the app, then that’s
a huge piece of data missing.</em></p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Early notification is key to the success of the COVID Alert app in
breaking the chain of infection by encouraging self-isolation until
direction from public heath authorities can be sought. […] To date, more
than 80% of users who receive an OTK enter it into the app; however,
fewer than 5% of positive cases have obtained an OTK from their public
health authority.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Again, lets assume those who get an key self isolate. That’s less than
5% of positive cases self isolating. Public health requires the entire
public to participate. 5% participating is simply too low.</em></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The report outlines reasons that users uninstall the app:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Perceives that the app is not user-friendly;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Believes that the app will not be substantially effective without broader public uptake;</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>I believe this as well, and this statement is why I uninstalled the
app. Digital contact tracing can provide some insight if most of the
population uses it, much like in China, South Korea or Taiwan. With less
than 5% of positive cases entering a key and only 18% of the population
having downloaded the app (not sure how many actually use it), the data
is just random noise.</em></p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Does not receive any exposure notifications and therefore assumes that
the app is not performing as designed;</p>

<p><em>Obviously this is because there’s literally such low numbers of data
being collected, which gives people the impression that COVID-19 isn’t
transmitting around that munch, which is totally incorrect. The app
simply can’t reflect the true transmission rates because not enough data
is being entered.</em></p>

contact-based and not location-based);</p>

consequences (e.g., isolating, testing); or</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>if you were to receive a diagnosis, you would probably prefer a
human tell you, rather than an app. With an app, there’s no one to help

hard to determine, because of how variants aren’t turning up as positive
on rapid tests and the lack of tests in the first place.</em></p>

</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>allowing users, specifically for health care workers, to manually turn
the app off when wearing the appropriate personal protective equipment
in areas with high likelihood of being near COVID-positive persons

<ul>
<li>
<p><em>this makes some sense, but further research would need to be done.</em></p>
</li>
</ul>

<li>
<p>allowing users to clear the exposed state following a negative test
result, in order to permit users to receive new exposure notifications.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>guidance must be given on this. Since rapid tests aren’t always
accurate, someone may take a false negative as being no longer infected,
when in fact they are still contagious.</em></p>

</ul>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>These points oversimplify COVID-19 to just "avoiding" someone when
they are most infectious, and encouraging people to prematurely return
back to society when they may still be infectious. Transmission can
occur when you’re not even beside an infected individual. The virus can
linger in the air. Nothing about letting users know about CO2 levels or
air transmission is mentioned.</em></p>

individuals and businesses in Canada to have trust in the app’s ability

simple models that may not be accurate. It’s been two years since the

eating at a restaurant is safe or not. Digital contact tracing, at its
current state, does not provide any useful information to citizens.
There are no metrics mentioned, after more than one year of use, if this
app prevented anyone from being infected. We can’t say the app has
assisted at all in limiting spread of COVID-19 if there’s no metrics to
back that up.</em></p>

<p>Since it’s been almost two (or three) years since the pandemic started,
we know more about how the COVID-19 virus infects and transmits. I want
to first say that based on how Western societies treated about viruses
(not really airborne, hoping that washing hands and social distancing
should be enough) and the fear around saying COVID-19 transmitted via
the air, our response was understandable. But it’s been a year since,
and digital contact tracing apps haven’t really demonstrated a
contribution to reducing infection. Here are the reasons I want to
highlight on why I think it there’s a low chance of Canada being able to
adopt a digital contact tracing app and why I think the digital contact
tracing app is inaccurate:</p>

</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By devoting considerable resources, including police investigation, 75
of the 92 cases of local transmission were traced back to their presumed
exposure, either to a known case or to a location linked to spread (15).
Linking cases via a location generally includes the possibility of
environmentally mediated transmission. Therefore, the large fraction of
traceable transmission in Singapore does not contradict the large
fraction without symptomatic exposure in Wuhan.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It’s understandable that we assumed COVID-19 wasn’t airborne, as other
deadly illnesses like cholera and polio spread through fluids and fecal
matter. Declaring a virus is airborne is also alarming, and as a global
body, WHO may have thought it was their responsibility not to
accidentally set a false alarm. However, we now know that COVID-19 is
airborne<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_5" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_5" title="View footnote.">5</a>]</sup>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Digital contract tracing apps which use proximity to determine exposure
reduce COVID-19 transmission into the notion that we only need to be
near sick people to get sick. When not much was known about COVID-19
transmission and it was believed to transmit through respiratory
droplets that quickly fell to the ground, this would have been a model
that made sense. But with more research highlighting evidence on
COVID-19 transmission occurring when people aren’t near each other and
that particles of up to 100 microns can stay in the air, proximity isn’t
a good measure for exposure anymore and downplays how transmissible
COVID-19 is. Canada’s digital contact tracing app uses 2 metres as a
proximity measure, but you can be infected from distances much
farther<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_6" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_6" title="View footnote.">6</a>]</sup> and many factors (like masking and air filtration) play into what distance is "safe".</p>

emitted in isolation without accounting for the exhaled air. The reality
involves a continuum of droplet sizes and an important role of the
exhaled air that carries them. Smaller airborne droplets laden with
SARS-CoV-2 may spread up to 8 metres concentrated in exhaled air from
infected individuals, even without background ventilation or airflow.
Whilst there is limited direct evidence that live SARS-CoV-2 is
significantly spread via this route, there is no direct evidence that it
is not spread this way.</p>

<p>With surface spreading viruses or fluid (liquid) spreading viruses, we
don’t need to be near someone to get sick. People can get infected with
cholera by using water from a stream that could be miles away from the
infected person. We need to be in contact with that surface or fluid to
get sick. It doesn’t matter if that person is close or not, though that
person being close can increase the risk of us getting sick, it’s not
the main determining factor. In fact, there are several cases of
COVID-19 transmission between people who have never seen each other, but
have breathed the same air via air conditioning<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_7" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_7" title="View footnote.">7</a>]</sup>.</p>

<p>In virology lecture we are taught that airborne particles can be
respiratory droplets or aerosolised particles. Respiratory droplets
eventually fall to the ground, while aerosolised particles can linger in
the air.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At the beginning of the pandemic, WHO made the erroneous judgement that
COVID-19 was spread through respiratory droplets that eventually fall
onto surfaces and then infect those that touch those surfaces. This
mistake led Western nations to slap a sanitizer machine at every
building entrance, increase their sanitization of desks and more surface
focused cleaning<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_8" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_8" title="View footnote.">8</a>]</sup>. On the contrary, many Asian countries
have ignored the CDC<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_9" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_9" title="View footnote.">9</a>]</sup>, acting on research
that paints COVID-19 as a much more infectious virus than WHO and
Western nations think. And it seems to have paid off.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Why did WHO decide that COVID-19 wasn’t airborne? Well, since
transmission was thought to occur through sneezes, coughs, etc, that
expel large respiratory droplets, WHO thought that these respiratory
droplets would just fall to the ground. Lots of medical experts were
making the assumption that most viruses weren’t airborne since particles
were bigger than 5 microns<sup class="footnote" id="_footnote_science-screwup-airborne">[<a id="_footnoteref_10" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_10" title="View footnote.">10</a>]</sup>.
However, maybe
respiratory droplets do stay in the air longer than we thought.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There’s a history<sup class="footnoteref">[<a class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_10" title="View footnote.">10</a>]</sup> that may have been a reason
why WHO acted the way they did.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In 1934, Wells and his wife, Mildred Weeks Wells, a physician, analyzed
air samples and plotted a curve showing how the opposing forces of
gravity and evaporation acted on respiratory particles. The couple’s
calculations made it possible to predict the time it would take a
particle of a given size to travel from someone’s mouth to the ground.
According to them, particles bigger than 100 microns sank within
seconds. Smaller particles stayed in the air. Randall paused at the
curve they’d drawn. To her, it seemed to foreshadow the idea of a
droplet-aerosol dichotomy, but one that should have pivoted around 100
microns, not 5.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So what happened? Why haven’t we been using the 100 micron metric? Well,</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Part of medical rhetoric is understanding why certain ideas take hold
and others don’t. So as spring turned to summer, Randall started to
investigate how Wells’ contemporaries perceived him. That’s how she
found the writings of Alexander Langmuir, the influential chief
epidemiologist of the newly established CDC. Like his peers, Langmuir
had been brought up in the Gospel of Personal Cleanliness, an obsession
that made handwashing the bedrock of US public health policy. He seemed
to view Wells’ ideas about airborne transmission as retrograde, seeing
in them a slide back toward an ancient, irrational terror of bad air—the
"miasma theory" that had prevailed for centuries. Langmuir dismissed
them as little more than "interesting theoretical points."</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And then after Langmuir disparaged Well’s work he came up with this:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the report, Langmuir cited a few studies from the 1940s looking at
the health hazards of working in mines and factories, which showed the
mucus of the nose and throat to be exceptionally good at filtering out
particles bigger than 5 microns. The smaller ones, however, could slip
deep into the lungs and cause irreversible damage. If someone wanted to
turn a rare and nasty pathogen into a potent agent of mass infection,
Langmuir wrote, the thing to do would be to formulate it into a liquid
that could be aerosolized into particles smaller than 5 microns, small
enough to bypass the body’s main defenses. Curious indeed. Randall made
a note.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Langmuir did eventually shift his tone and accept that airborne
infection was possible. After Well’s died, Langmuir delivered a speech
stating "problematic particles—the ones they had to worry about—were
smaller than 5 microns."" And that screw up started it all<sup class="footnoteref">[<a class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_10" title="View footnote.">10</a>]</sup>.
However, particles that are up to 100 microns are also airborne!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While most viruses are 0.1 to 0.5 microns, viruses hitch a ride on the
droplets that we produce when breathing, sneezing or coughing. From this
experiment<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_11" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_11" title="View footnote.">11</a>]</sup> there are droplets that measure at below or
around 100 microns. This means someone’s sneeze can travel around a
room.</p>
</div>
<hr>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Okay, that was a lot of reading. I wanted to set up why the virus being
airborne is important and how digital contact tracing misses on this.
Digital contact tracing apps seems like a fun algorithmic problem to
determine who’s been near whom! Which is just another complex public
health and social problem reduced into a algorithm. It seemed perfect.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But the app is missing a lot of context. For one, depending on whether
or no the air is actively being filtered, being 6 ft (or 2 metres) may
be enough distance, or it might not be. And depending on one’s mask,
this further complicates what distance and time you can inhale infected
air is "safe" from being exposed to infection, The app simply doesn’t
know, and giving erroneous information is worse than no information. The
app doesn’t know anything about the quality of the air. Distance doesn’t
matter so much if the air is being constantly filtered. A CO2 monitor
would be more helpful than an app that tells me if I’ve been near a sick
person. Basically, the app totally simplifies and neglects how air
transmission works. The only way you can tell if you’ve been exposed is
if you have a CO2 monitor telling you if air is being filtered and
circulated around enough such that you aren’t breathing in the air other
people exhale.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Since COVID-19 virus is airborne, one should assume no distance and time
near infected air is safe, unless they had data to tell them otherwise.
For instance, it would be useful to know if I was in a restaurant or
building that had bad air quality. Much of the public has no access to
knowledge of whether their air is being filtered or not, or the quality
of the filter. If we aren’t able to access high quality, real time data
on positive cases, understanding our air quality is the next best piece
of data we can use to make informed choices.</p>

<h3 id="_to_get_infected_viruses_require_affinity_and_avidity_with_the_human_receptor">To get infected, viruses require affinity and avidity with the human receptor.</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There’s a lot of chemistry, physics and biology involved in getting
infected. First, the physics of viruses. Viruses spread through surface,
liquid and air. The physics for each medium is different, and it’s
important we all have some basic understanding of how to prevent
transmission given the medium of spread.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But preventing transmission isn’t always possible. To become infected,
viruses require affinity and avidity. What does this mean? Well it’s
time for chemistry. Affinity is how strongly two molecules will react
with each other. We can think of this as the binding event between the
virus and human receptor. The stronger the binding event, the better.
More specifically if the virus has more affinity to bind than the native
molecule that usually binds to the human receptor, then the virus is on
its first step to infecting us. Next, we must have avidity, which is the
accumulated strength of multiple
affinities<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_13" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_13" title="View footnote.">13</a>]</sup>.
Affinity isn’t always enough, thus, if there’s more virus than native
molecule, the higher concentration of virus can out compete the native
molecule. Once some threshold is met, you are infected.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And the biology is how our body responds. Our immune systems will
respond first, however infection can involve other organs, such as our
lungs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Okay, so what does this mean? There are some things we can’t control,
like how a virus spreads or which human receptor the virus will bind to
and how strongly that virus will bind. But there are some things we can
control, like avidity (how many virus particles) and our immune
response. We can control our avidity to a virus by wearing high quality
masks and requesting better air filtration. We can control our immune
response by getting vaccines.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Unfortunately, education on proper masks has been non-existent, with
some health leaders suggesting that cloth masks are still okay to wear

<h3 id="_testing">Testing</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Canada digital tracking app requires a one time key to use if you
have a confirmed positive case of COVID-19. I would assume this means
those who don’t have access to tests wouldn’t be able to self report
their positive case or if they were feeling symptoms (I’m not sure).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This goes against the advice that the paper gives:</p>

</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Much of the success of the app relies on quickly and accurately
detecting positive cases with testing. However, with variants that
aren’t always showing up on rapid tests, the delay of results with PCR

limits who can get tested.</p>

the accuracy of digital tracking apps will be pretty low.</p>

<h3 id="_viruses_mutate_at_random_a_lot">Viruses mutate at random. A lot.</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But viruses don’t mutate everywhere at random. We’ve observed with
COVID-19 variants and other coronaviruses that there are some conserved
regions that undergo mutation a lot less. For instance, the residues of
the substrate-binding pocket are highly conserved<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_16" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_16" title="View footnote.">16</a>]</sup> and don’t really undergo much
mutation, since this protein is essential to replication and proteolytic
processing.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But the spike protein on the other hand goes through a lot of mutation.
For instance, many Omicron’s
mutations<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_17" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_17" title="View footnote.">17</a>]</sup> are associated with the ACE2 receptor binding and
antibody binding sites (our vaccines currently target these proteins).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Mutations are random, but those random mutations that can survive
current drugs and vaccines are the mutations that will continue to
spread. Mutations that occur on proteins like the main protease may also
occur, but some mutations are more deadly to the virus than others, and
these mutated viruses simply cease to replicate, ending their ability to
spread.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With that being said, for current drugs and vaccines to continue
working, we have to slow down the chance for the virus mutate. The
likelihood of mutation increases as more and more people become
infected. This means we must prevent infection.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>People will argue that infection is mild, but getting infected isn’t
just about getting infected. It’s about whether you become the new
reservoir to the next COVID-19 variant.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Digital contact tracing apps can give someone an over simplified model
of how COVID-19 transmits; using proximity doesn’t make much sense since
the virus can stick around in the air and viral load is dependent on a
lot of factors like masking and air ventilation/filtration. The longer
and more we get infected, the more variants there will be. It’s time to
ditch the app and go back to tracking data and using methods like
masking and air filtration; methods that work.</p>

<h2 id="_adoption_of_the_app_by_the_public">Adoption of the app by the public</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I was excited by the announcement of Canada’s digital tracking app after
hearing about the success in South Korea and China. However, as I
highlighted above, I later uninstalled app because no one was using it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The paper<sup class="footnoteref">[<a class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_2" title="View footnote.">2</a>]</sup> mentions some important
points. Firstly, in China the app was a success because:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Public health policy was implemented using an app that was not
compulsory but was required to move between quarters and into public

</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Obviously, that sort of adoption has not happened in Canada and probably
will not. Only 15-20% of the Canada’s population has installed the app.
If we play with some simulations here and assume 20% of Canadians will
self-isolate, maybe assuming 20% of infections will be stopped, this is
still not enough to move COVID-19 into endemic phase. This
analysis<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_18" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_18" title="View footnote.">18</a>]</sup> done quite early during
the pandemic, which was based on early research and the less
transmissible original COVID-19 variant, states we only need to stop 60%
of infections.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Other points the paper mentions, such as:</p>

<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">

All in all, I see a low chance for the app gaining a large enough
adoption for the app to become an accurate tool to use as a means to
decreasing infections.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For a digital contact tracing app to have some impact on reducing
infections we need:
* access to lots of quick and accurate tests
* a preventative mindset towards being exposed, as outlined in the paper:
"If testing capacity is limited, individuals who are identified by
tracing may be presumed confirmed upon onset of symptoms, because the
prior probability of them being positive is higher than for the index
case."
* ability for people to upload self confirmed tests to the app
adoption of the app by 60%* of the population
* people to actually self-isolate until they are no longer sick
* a better way to measure exposure risk: using masking and air filtration/circulation to predict
exposure risk or understanding that the virus can linger in the air, so
letting users know if they have been in the same location as someone who
was infected, regardless of how far or how long they were near that
infected individual</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>However</em>, to prevent new variants and prevent long COVID I believe we
must work towards no infections at all, not just reducing infections. I
understand this is a more extreme stance, but drug and vaccine
development simply will always lag behind the virus, and developing
drugs and vaccines isn’t easy! Since 100% (or even 50%) adoption and
<strong>use</strong> of the app isn’t feasible, I don’t think digital contact tracing
works in a Western society.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It’s worth the time and money to keep trying to use digital contact
tracing apps at this stage. Alberta spent $4.3 million<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_19" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_19" title="View footnote.">19</a>]</sup>
on their digital contact tracing app, which only notified 1,500 people of possible
exposure. We <strong>know</strong> what works. Good quality masks, air filtration and circulation and UV lighting to kill
the virus in high risk places like hospitals. We also have metrics that
can help us predict areas of increasing infection (waste water tracking)
and possible exposure risk (CO2 monitoring). In a Western society, the
digital contact tracing app will not get us out of the pandemic.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">

<p>I use 60% as outlined above, but I don’t actually know what number
would be needed to reduce the R value.</p>
