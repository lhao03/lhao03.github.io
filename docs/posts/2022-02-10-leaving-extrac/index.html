<p><em>CW: swearing, breaking down, negativity</em></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I think it was in my first year that I attended my first hackathon and
that’s when decided it would be cool to be behind the scenes of a
hackathon. So that’s when I decided to try applying to hackathon
organization teams.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_beginnings">Beginnings</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In my first year, I tried my hand at joining a development team and was
rejected. My boyfriend was accepted and was involved in the team for a
year. I’m glad I was rejected; the development work was not something I
was interested in (At the time in my first year, I was trying to get any
experience, and didn’t really care what experience it was) and my
boyfriend was even less interested in it (but was the one who had to do
it, unfortunately). Also, the whole aspect of group work is awful,
because if no one’s doing it then shit doesn’t get done; I would often
see my boyfriend doing most of the work. And in fact, to this day he’s
still a top contributor on some project repositories even though he
hasn’t touched the code base for more than a year.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And that led me to be more interested in the logistics of hackathons. I
had a small moment after my first year; I missed chemistry and it was
hard to see why I should have stayed in computer science because I was a
slow learner (in high school, I was among the top students in my
chemistry class and in my first-year chemistry classes I got A+, so I
wasn’t used to struggling as I did in computer science classes) and the
weird culture of computer science students thinking they were on the
verge of something or that they were the future; no JavaScript and AI
isn’t going to change the world as you would hope so. So I decided I’d
rather be involved in encouraging more minorities to pursue computer
science alongside another field, which is where I am today studying
computer science, biochemistry, and chemistry.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_getting_into_marketing">Getting into… Marketing?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Anyways, I then applied to join the operations team at StarHacks,
putting marketing as my backup. I wanted to gain some experience before
applying to the cmd-f logistics team at nwPlus. I was accepted, but for
marketing to my dismay. Since this would be the first hackathon I’d be
involved in, I said yes to the opportunity. And I’m glad I took the
opportunity and I did so much more than marketing. I loved everything
about the role at StarHacks; the group of minorities I helped inspire,
the people I worked with, managing a Discord server, playing with
Discord bots, and creating and researching new content to promote. But I
hated marketing; monitoring social media accounts was the last thing I
ever wanted to do. Unfortunately, that was my role on the team. I wanted
to plan out workshops, pick inspirational speakers, and shape the way
someone was introduced to computer science. I wanted to show that
computer science was more than coding; it was the way computers can
communicate with another computer, how the hardware and software
communicate, how the individual could communicate with the software and
trust that the software would communicate correctly with the hardware,
theories of computer science and much more. Nothing to do with web
development or HTML or for loops in Python, which is what every club or
event seemed to be promoting. And how computer science could be
integrated into other fields like public policy, healthcare, climate
change, and more.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Despite my annoyances, I helped put on StarHacks I and II. I increased
registration from 800 to 1200 (I to II) and our speakers for SH I and II
were amazing. I was proud of the event I helped build, but I still
wanted to be part of the planning team, instead of someone in marketing.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Since I was sure I had more hackathon experience, I applied for the
logistics team at nwPlus. I did the interview and then was asked to
interview for the marketing team instead. I was sad about not being able
to get into logistics but I asked myself; was the role more important,
or the overall impact you could have just being part of the club. I
chose the latter and accepted the offer for marketing, but deep down I
knew that the actual role was more important to me.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I’ve been asked "Why marketing?" and my response is something like: "I
think marketing is essential because it allows a group/company to share
their values with individuals and expose individuals to a product or
event that could change their lives, who would have never known without
the outreach".
But I didn’t really get to do that. What marketing
really was, was copy-pasting captions into Instagram, clicking posts,
and then spamming other clubs to share your post. Absolutely mundane
work.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Being the external eyes and look of something also means you interact
with other groups trying to do the same thing as you. And it just feels
so artificial now. Everyone wants you to share their opportunity.
Everyone is making their iteration of the same idea. But why??? I don’t
think most groups create events or opportunities with intention. Most
workshops are copies of each other, and topics are generic, random, and
poorly executed in some cases. Additionally, I hate the
"girlification" of things like "girlboss", "stemist". Not only does
it separate women further than their male peers, but what does
"girlboss" or "stemnist" even mean? what do these words imply?
There’s no word like "boyboss" or "stemboys" because it sounds
ridiculous. This is why I cared much more about the role I would be
involved in. I was essentially sometimes marketing events I wasn’t
personally aligned with. And then comes the overworking.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_being_a_giver">Being a Giver</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Anyways, I also have a fear, or more like the feeling I need to give it
my all. I believe that when I say something I better do it and I better
do it as best as I can, and I get scared if I don’t do something then
people will dislike me for it. This is probably what has crippled me the
most. But not everyone feels that way. I believe that if I give as much
care and work into something, others will too. But that’s so wrong, and
a truth I need to learn. Sometimes if you’re lucky, a team does mirror
your efforts. I think the StarHacks team does this. But that is rare and
in most extracurriculars, it’s been me doing a lot of the work; either
unasked of or because other team members simply didn’t. At nwPlus, I had
to become the unofficial Director for a few weeks because the actual
Marketing Director just didn’t do anything. It wasn’t something I wanted
to do, but my fear of being seen as lazy pushed me into doing the role
of Director and eventually becoming a Co-Director, a role I just felt
like I had to take because I’m scared of disappointing people.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This behavior probably came from school group work where I felt like I
was forced to do everything, and that same mindset is also present in
other group work scenarios. As a "gifted"<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_1" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_1" title="View footnote.">1</a>]</sup> student in a predominantly
white school, teachers would ask me to help other students, put me in
groups with underperforming students, and the like. This has resulted in
me responding to every slack message no matter what else I was doing
(workout, class, literally anything) spending hours doing something that
wasn’t even assigned to me, pestering others to do their work, usually
it was me doing it anyways. Every time I did the work that was supposed
to be assigned to someone else, I would get apologies and thank
yous. But were they sincere? If they were, then I wouldn’t always be
the one picking up the slack. It wouldn’t be a common occurrence. What’s
missing from that apology or thank you note is "sorry/thank you for
doing my work, I thought my time was more important than yours and I
trusted that you would just pick up all of my work.". When you continually
let your work fall on others, that’s what you’re saying to them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I, unfortunately, was giving too much of my time, and suffered mentally
and physically; I eventually broke down after StarHacks II. I had just
wasted two weekends glued to my laptop either marketing an event in
real-time or moderating on Discord and Zoom. I faced abuse from some
hackers and to add on I:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>broke down both in front of the StarHacks team and then with my bf</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>had to drop three courses I wanted to take; I had 5 courses planned
out for my second term, and I’m now only doing three because of how
behind I was in my other courses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>got an eye infection</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>fucked up my organic chemistry midterm which was 2 days after the hackathon</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All of this could have been prevented, had I not been involved in
extracurriculars that forced me to give up my time because I couldn’t
depend on others.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Was I good at marketing? Who knows, I sure as hell don’t. Do I like
marketing? Hell no. Then why I was still doing it?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This breakdown has caused me to reevaluate the way I spend my time and
why I spend it that way. Why am I even in marketing at nwPlus if I
disliked it so much? Why did I keep giving my time to others when I was
flailing around myself? Why did I continue to help put on hackathons
when <a href="../../posts/hackathons">I didn’t even like them myself</a>?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I’m planning to leave all hackathon-related activities eventually. As to
not disrupt the team (which happened to the marketing team at nwPlus,
when our Director led our team to a pretty bad marketing run for
HackCamp, and then left), I’m going to leave when the hackathon season
ends. It’s not fair to others who are working hard and care about nwPlus
for me to leave abruptly like a former teammate did, because there are
some amazing and passionate people at nwPlus who have helped me so much
when I was trying to take on the role of Director (and for that, thank
you, y’all should know who you are). I’m writing this out to hold myself
accountable.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I do still want to help people, but only how I want to. I like helping
people in a way that benefits me too. There are two ways: - TAing -
informal coffee chats</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_taing">TAing</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I enjoy TAing because I can interact with other students and help from
breakthrough problems they are having with course content. I’ve also
formed a mentor-mentee type relationship with some students who also ask
about upper-year courses, co-op, internships, or computer science in
general. It’s also nice to talk to other TAs, who want to TA for the
same reasons that you are TAing.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_informal_coffee_chats">Informal Coffee Chats</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Sometimes students in high school or students I’ve TAed at UBC message
me on Linkedin and I’m always happy to send a chat message to them. It’s
nice because they took the time out of their day to approach you and
usually in writing they think of concise questions to ask.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_gaining_my_time_back">Gaining my time back</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I’ve deleted slack off all my devices except my laptop. I only check
within a certain time and then get back to work. I think more before
signing up for volunteer roles; do I want to do this? And lastly, I’m
taking more time for myself to learn freely by attending panels, reading
random stuff, or just relaxing. I watch more animal YouTube videos
nowadays or I just lay in bed thinking.</p>
