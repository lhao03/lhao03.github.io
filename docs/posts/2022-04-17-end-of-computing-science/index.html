<p>prof. dr. Edsger W. Dijkstra talks about how</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>computing has "matured" from a theoretical topic for the scientists to
a practical issue for the engineers, managers and the entrepreneurs</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As a student who has felt a disconnect between a computer science degree
and the jobs people pursue with a computer science degree, I resonate
with this statement very well.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I like computer science, but not the tech industry. The elegance and
beauty of computer science has been diminished to slow, inefficient
JavaScript programs full of bugs and security vulnerabilities with
flashy marketing, and these embarrassing programs are praised by
managers, venture capitalists, and PMs who have little care and almost
no desire to understand and appreciate computer science.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>who can accept the application of science for the obvious benefits, but
feel rather uncomfortable with its creation because they don’t
understand what the doing of research, with its intangible goals and its
uncertain rewards, entails.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The eventual application of science can only be possible through
research. You can’t apply a formula that hasn’t had years of research
and theory behind it. Even though the application of chemistry (drugs)
inspires me to pursue studies in chemistry, drugs can only be discovered
and conceptualized through hours and hours of thinking and going in
circles. For a long time, I was scared of research too. At my first
internship I’d spend hours after my work day had ended thinking about a
problem I was stuck on. I’d spend an entire week trying to implement a
solution and show up to my weekly meeting to only present nothing to the
lead surgeon and professor. I also made a mistake, and spent 2 days
unable to focus because of the fear of disappointing my research team.
Research can painful and can drive you insane. But when you accomplish
something, no matter how small, that feeling is better than any feeling
I’ve ever felt in any industry job.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I would therefore like to posit that computing’s central challenge,
viz. "How not to make a mess of it", has not been met. On the
contrary, most of our systems are much more complicated than can be
considered healthy, and are too messy and chaotic to be used in comfort
and confidence. The average customer of the computing industry has been
served so poorly that he expects his system to crash all the time, and
we witness a massive worldwide distribution of bug-ridden software for
which we should be deeply ashamed.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In organic chemistry we learn so many different pathways to the same
drug. In the next year’s organic chemistry course we learn why some
pathways are unfeasible. We lose points on exams for coming up with
dangerous or lengthy pathways. There are strict protocols and standards
for creating drugs and a lot more thought into creating drugs. You can
take Advil (within a healthy dosage) and not expect something dangerous
to happen.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But can you say this about software? In courses, I’m rarely judged on my
actual code, but rather if my code can pass some tests. Inefficient and
unreadable code is given the same grade as efficient and maintainable
code. There’s no incentive to do better. In fact, at my Microsoft
internship I was told to avoid refactoring code, and faced much
opposition when I presented a PR with refactored code. PRs with untested
features were accepted quicker than my PR that just refactored code. My
manager, who never cared about what I did prior to the code refactor,
suddenly pulled me into a meeting to ask if the code refactor really was
necessary. And there were no bugs discovered in my refactored code.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Our apps have became more and more bloated, with data leaks every hour,
and having something "work" isn’t the norm, but the outlier. Companies
deliberately choose horrible languages to write programs in like
JavaScript, push confusing design changes instead of security
improvements and freeze our computers with memory leaks. I can say with
confidence that every single person has probably had some type of
personal data leaked. I had my first leak of personal data thanks to
LinkedIn.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therac-25">Even worse, software has
poisoned people</a>.
<a href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~ztatlock/pubs/neutrons-pernsteiner-cav16.pdf">Perhaps
this could of been avoided if we verified the correctness of the
software</a>, but apparently we’ve decided verifying most programs is too
costly, and instead poured billions of dollars into memory and energy
draining flashy AI models that have proven almost 100% of the time to be
racist and down right horrifying.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Windows crashes once a week, and I have to move <em>my</em> schedule around for
software; shouldn’t it be the other way around? Software should cater to
us.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For us scientists it is very tempting to blame the lack of education of
the average engineer, the short-sightedness of the managers and the
malice of the entrepreneurs for this sorry state of affairs, but that
won’t do. You see, while we all know that unmastered complexity is at
the root of the misery, we do not know what degree of simplicity can be
obtained, nor to what extent the intrinsic complexity of the whole
design has to show up in the interfaces.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The statement "unmastered complexity is the root of misery" could be
talking about the
<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/Dunning-Kruger-effect">Dunning-Kruger
effect</a>, in which Silicon Valley tech bros go around creating short
sighted solutions without the input of the groups affected, which then
cause harms to others. Or the statement could be talking about the state
of a researcher, who may feel misery and despair due to their lack of
mastery in the topic they are researching. I feel is it the latter.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We do not know yet whether trade-offs will be possible. We do not know
yet whether we can invent for intricacy a meaningful concept about which
we can prove theorems that help.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A professor once stated to my boyfriend who then told me, that
"optimization is optimization until your optimization produces
something wrong, and if that happens then you’re cheating". I believe
this is what these "trade-offs" are talking about. There’s a lot of
trade-offs in science in hopes of making a topic simpler. We use the
Bohr model to represent the electrons and protons for an element; but
there’s a trade-off. The trade-off is that for simplicity we may give
students the impression that electrons orbit in circles or ovals or that
electrons stay "stuck" in orbit. This is an "optimization". And
sometimes optimizations can become cheating; an optimization works until
it can’t. Obviously catching these cheating optimizations is important,
but how can we? I think that is what prof. dr. Edsger W. Dijkstra’s
second sentence implies.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We do not know yet whether intrinsic intricacy can be distinguished from
accidental intricacy. … To put it bluntly, we simply do not know yet
what we should be talking about, but that should not worry us, for it
just illustrates what was meant by "intangible goals and uncertain
rewards".</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Research is a dive into the unknown. For instance, virologists for many
years have noticed that certain biomarkers, like, intracellular miRNAs
that were down regulated were exosomal-associated miRNA. Exosomes with
miRNA were exiting the cell. For the previous years, not much focus was
given on these miRNAs; they were thought as perhaps a byproduct of the
influenza virus. But what was causing this down regulation? Was it even
associated with the influenza virus (accidental intricacy or intrinsic
intricacy?). And what molecule, foreign or self, was causing this?
<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25234642/">Well, virologists found out
that miR-24, which was leaving the cell, correlated with an increased
expression of furin in H5N1 strain of influenza</a>. Previously ignored,
miRNA has become a key factor in the viral life cycle. Most importantly
is that virologists didn’t know they were looking for miRNA.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In fact, microRNAs (miRNA) are non-coding RNA, which means they don’t
become proteins themselves, but influence what and how much of the
coding RNA become proteins. This makes it really hard to study since
there’s "nothing" we can grasp onto. There’s no protein to take a
closer look at. We can only make guesses on which proteins are affected
by the billions of non-coding regions. These molecules were discovered
in worms in 1993 and only known to exist in humans in the last decade.
Since we have only analyzed mostly coding regions of the genome, miRNAs
are a completely new area.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Why do I talk about virology research? Well, I hope I made it clear that
no one knew what they were looking for. Computing Science is still a
relatively new area of research that has so much to be explored.
Unfortunately, lots of money has been poured into AI, which other areas
like ethics, hardware, compiler, proof verification and more much more
underfunded. We need to do research that has "intangible goals and
uncertain rewards". Research in AI seems to contradict this statement.
There’s always a goal: make machines more like humans or make machines
replace humans. And there’s always a desired reward: money.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The moral is that whether Computing Science is finished will primarily
depend on our courage and our imagination.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Research isn’t all knowledge, as probably almost every researcher has
told you. There’s also imagination and intuition and courage. You can’t
be driven by goals like money or status. Science doesn’t care if you can
figure out why something happens or prove why something is right.
Science owes nothing to you. All we can do is keep imagining and pushing
the field of computing science forward.</p>
