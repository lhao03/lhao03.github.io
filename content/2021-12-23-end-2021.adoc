== Turning 20

I feel like it’s more common for a university student in Vancouver to
not have a driver’s license than to have one. My parents told me the
longer I wait to get my driver’s license, the harder it would be, since
learning how to drive at an older age was harder. But I don’t see a
reason to learn how to drive, because taking the bus is easier in
Vancouver than in Calgary and I don’t have access to a car.

But I guess now I’m in my early 20s? It still feels like I’m 16; kinda
excited for the world but also kinda scared. These days it’s leaning
more towards feeling more scared than excited.

== I think I might have taken on too much; thinking about my education

I was excited to get back to you in person. I was even more excited when
I got a TA offer for CPSC 110. I was even more excited to take my first
biochemistry class and CPSC 213. But I took on too much this term. I was
also involved with 3 side projects, one being part of the nwPlus team,
another being part of the StarHacks team, and lastly one side project
that I had to drop out of. I was tired every day, exhausted, and could
barely focus. My sleep varied anywhere from 5 hours to 9, and I felt the
effects of an inconsistent sleep schedule. I also felt like I didn’t
have enough time to study, but let’s see if that’s true.

For reference, per credit, you should dedicate 2-3 hours of study time
per week. Most of my courses were 3 credits, so I should be spending 9
hours per week. I had one 4 credit course, CPSC 213, and that course
would expect around 12 hours per week of study. I’m choosing the upper
bounds because I struggle with computer science and math courses.

Looking back on time spent per subject, it seems to me like I spent: -
CPSC 213: 135 hrs total, 10.38 hrs/week - MATH 200: 129 hrs total, 9.92
hrs/week - CPSC 320: 110 hrs total, 8.46 hrs/week - BIOC 202: 91 hrs
total, 7 hrs/week - MICB 306: 68 hrs total, 5.23 hrs/week

All data were calculated from September 7th to December 7th (13 weeks).
I’m surprised that I did spend enough time on my CPSC and MATH courses,
but I felt like I was always behind in them. On the contrary, I wasn’t
spending nearly as much time in my BIOC and MICB courses, but I always
felt like I knew what was happening and I never fell behind too badly in
those courses. I guess this means I’m not studying very efficiently in
my CPSC and MATH courses. That’s something I’m going to have to think
about; how I can efficiently and effectively study in CPSC and MATH.

== Thinking about my future

Working at Microsoft changed what I wanted to do after I graduated. I
didn’t have the best time, (maybe I’ll write about it), and had some
breakdowns that are related to how I felt about my experience at
Microsoft. To keep it short and simple, I didn’t like the corporate
world. Someone who helped me get through the time at Microsoft, and
someone I look up tofootnote:[https://github.com/anneguo3[Anne Guo’s
GitHub]], led to me reading this
articlefootnote:[https://noidea.dog/glue[Being Glue]] and watching this
videofootnote:[https://www.ted.com/talks/adam_grant_are_you_a_giver_or_a_taker[Are you
a giver or a taker?]]. Again, to put it short and sweet, there was someone
on our team that required me to give a lot, and I broke down in the
process. Even better (well actually worse), I interviewed to return to a
health and tech-focused team at Microsoft, but was rejected because my
project was lacking technically; since my project wasn’t technically
challenging enough, the health team decided that I was lacking in
technical skills, in comparison to other candidates. To say I was
crushed at the time would be an understatement. Not only was I slightly
embarrassed, but this meant if I took my return offer, I would have to
work within the Teams organization (ew). I was left pretty soured by
this experience.

Another aspect of just corporate in general (and maybe Garage
Program-specific) was that I just felt like I was working on useless
sh*t that would never see the day of light. I need to see my work make
an impact, and I just felt like this project was something to keep the
interns busy. Even worse, the entire project was done in JavaScript and
C#, basically the last two programming languages I’d choose to work
with.

What was pretty awesome was that I bonded and become close friends with
two students from U of T, and we talk to this day about anything that
comes to our mind. We also played a bunch of Overcooked during our
internship 😳.

I think going to grad school for biochemistry, computer science or
biomedical engineering would be cool, but my grades aren’t the best, so
I’m not sure if that is the path I can take.

== On my appearance

This year I kinda did something wild (for me). I dyed the inside parts
of my hair blue and got my lobes double pierced. I’ve been thinking
about making these changes for at least a year and telling my boyfriend
about it every day. And when I got it done, I liked how it changed my
look. Maybe I’ll dye my hair again?? But I had to sit for around 5
hours, and that was quite painful, so maybe I’ll dye my hair once a
year.
