**Why did I make a failures page?**

When I first started university, I was very insecure about my abilities. I would assume everyone achieved success on their first try, while I seemed to swim in failures. But this isn't true, and unfortunately, we tend to focus on our unpleasant experiences (like failures) more than our pleasant experiences (successes). Essentially, this section of my website serves as a reminder to myself and those read it that failures and screwing up are normal.

I also read others' failure resumes and it helps me a lot, so I hope my failure resume can help you too.

Failures are subjective. What seems like a failure to me might not to you. I also recognize that I'm fortunate to have opportunities to fail and learn.

## 2022
- Stopped organizing hackathons. 
- Horrible course planning so I ended up with a very unbalanced year of courses. 
- Denied permission to pursue a combined major in Computer Science and Biochemistry. Sucks because I was really excited to get higher recognition of Biochemistry on my degree (right now it's a minor) and to not do MATH 221. And I don't really wanna pursue a double major because I'm not really interested in lab work.

## 2021
- Barely passed MATH 200. Broke down several times due to other courses too.
- My request to return to the Health team at Microsoft was rejected. I was also working overtime at Microsoft.
- Messed up my sleep schedule and have several health problems occur because of it.
- Poorly planned my courses in second year so I didn't get promoted to third year standing.
- Fell off my running streak; having a hard time getting back into running. Maybe I've just grown out of it.
- I got a C in a Environmental Microbiology.
- I forgot to apply for UBC iGEM.
- Failed an Organic Chemistry quiz.

## 2020
- Didn't get any internships for the summer. I mean, I had just finished my first year ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.
