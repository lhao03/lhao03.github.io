But after some reflection, now I realize there were many things that led to this low mark. Firstly, the instructor was very distant. No real time lectures meant I procrastinated watching them. Secondly, there were pages and pages to memorize for this course. Pair this with procrastination and you have disaster. The poor delivery of the course AND my poor planning led to my low mark."},

Since I took Chemistry HL as an IB student, I was able to skip first year chemistry, which meant I was quite rusty when I took CHEM 233, more than a year after my IB exams. For the future, I'll make to revisit my foundations!"},
