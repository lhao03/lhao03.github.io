{{ header(curr="about") }}

I'm a chemistry nerd and {{ inline(text="filter")}} and {{ inline(text="map")}} enthusiast studying {{ highlightLink(text="💻 Computer Science", link="https://www.cs.ubc.ca/")}} and {{ highlightLink(text="🧬 Biochemistry", link="https://biochem.ubc.ca/")}} at the {{ highlightLink(text="University of British Columbia", link="https://www.ubc.ca/")}}. If I'm not at my computer coding and eating dark chocolate 🍫, you can find me scrolling through pictures of Shiba Inus 🐕!

## Currently
As of now, for every computer science course I've taken, I've taken one life science course! This year I'm completing most of my low level computer science courses, the last of my math courses, my first biochemistry course (finally done all the biology and chemistry prerequisites), and a third year microbiology course! I'm also TAing {{ inline(text='(string-append "CPSC" "110")')}}. When I'm not confused about multivariable calculus, I'm catching up on webtoons, listening to K-pop, eating chocolate and lifting weights.

## Previously
I've helped design and implement a developer tool to interact with Microsoft Graph at {{ highlightLink(text="Microsoft Garage", link="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/garage/about/")}}, built a {{ highlightLink(text="natural language processing pipeline", link="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.04.21256134v1")}} to automate the extraction of patient information from clinical notes, listened to {{ highlightLink(text="21st Century Girl for 9268 minutes", link="/res/spotify/bts.jpg")}}, led some {{ highlightLink(text="technical workshops", link="/experience")}}, and mentored high schoolers.

## Quantified
- kilograms of chocolate consumed per year: 12 🍫
- most weight I've deadlifted: 205 lbs 🏋️‍♀️
- minutes of Spotify in 2021: 53888 🎶
- minutes of cat videos watched: infinite ∞
