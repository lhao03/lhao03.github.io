{{ header(curr="about") }}

I'm a chemistry nerd and {{ inline(text="filter")}} and {{ inline(text="map")}} enthusiast studying {{ highlightLink(text="💻 Computer Science", link="https://www.cs.ubc.ca/")}} and {{ highlightLink(text="🧬 Biochemistry", link="https://biochem.ubc.ca/")}} at the {{ highlightLink(text="University of British Columbia", link="https://www.ubc.ca/")}}. I enjoy learning about how and why things work, especially pertaining to biological processes, viruses, and programming languages. 

## Currently
- taking intro medical biochemistry, virology, intermediate algo design and analysis, calc III and intro to computer systems! See all my courses [here](/school).
- finishing up TAing {{ inline(text='(string-append "CPSC" "110")')}}. For the second term I'll take a break from TAing because I really want to focus more on school.  
- learning how to use Vim! I've finally deleted VSCode : ).
- gaining back pre-pandemic strength in the gym. I can now hip thrust 275 lbs (max before was 375 lbs), and squat 155 lbs!

## Previously
I've helped design and implement a developer tool to interact with Microsoft Graph at {{ highlightLink(text="Microsoft Garage", link="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/garage/about/")}}, built a {{ highlightLink(text="natural language processing pipeline", link="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.04.21256134v1")}} to automate the extraction of patient information from clinical notes, led some {{ highlightLink(text="technical workshops", link="/experience")}}, and mentored high schoolers.

## Quantified
- kilograms of chocolate consumed per year: 12 🍫
- most weight I've deadlifted: 205 lbs 🏋️‍♀️
- minutes of Spotify in 2021: 53888 🎶
- minutes of cat videos watched: infinite ∞
