I'm a chemistry nerd and `filter` and `map` enthusiast studying [💻 Computer Science](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/) and [🧪 Chemistry](https://www.chem.ubc.ca/) at the [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/). I enjoy learning about how and why things work, especially pertaining to biological processes (from a chemistry perspective), viruses, operating systems, and programming languages. I've also been thinking about how computer science education should work at the primary and secondary school level and enjoy reading about computing history and technological systems. Check out my fails [here].

## At the moment I'm...
- 🎒 taking courses in computer hardware and operating systems, organic chemistry, and genetics.

- 🤷🏻‍♀ had some [fails](@/failures/_index.md).
- 👋🏻 TAed some courses (CPSC 110 and CPSC 210).

- 💻 interned at Microsoft and learned some things I didn't like about the tech industry.
- 🏥 built a [natural language processing pipeline](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.04.21256134v1) for pathology reports at [PROOF Centre](https://www.proofcentre.ca/)
