I enjoy learning about how and why things work, especially pertaining to biological processes, viruses, operating systems, and programming languages. Check out my fails [here](@/failures/_index.md).

- 🏥 built a [natural language processing pipeline](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.04.21256134v1") for pathology reports at [PROOF Centre](https://www.proofcentre.ca/)
- 🏋️‍♀️ deadlifted 205 lbs pounds
