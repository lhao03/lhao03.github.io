I'm a chemistry nerd and {{ inline(text="filter")}} and {{ inline(text="map")}} enthusiast studying [💻 Computer Science](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/) and [🧪 Chemistry](https://www.chem.ubc.ca/) at the [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/). I enjoy learning about how and why things work, especially pertaining to biological processes (from a chemistry perspective), viruses, operating systems, and programming languages. I've also been thinking about how computer science education should work at the primary and secondary school level. Check out my fails [here](@/failures/_index.md).

## At the moment I'm...
- 🎒 taking courses in computer hardware and operating systems, organic chemistry, and genetics.
- ⌨️  learning how to use Vim! I've finally deleted VSCode	٩(◕‿◕)۶

## In a previous life...
- 👋🏻 TAed some courses (CPSC 110 and CPSC 210).
- 🦠 took a [virology course](/school/micb306)!
- 🖥️ interned at Microsoft;learned some things I don't like about the tech industry.
- 🏥 built a [natural language processing pipeline](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.04.21256134v1) for pathology reports at [PROOF Centre](https://www.proofcentre.ca/)
- 🏋️‍♀️ deadlifted 205 lbs pounds
- 🏃🏻‍♀ did competitive cross country running and track and field.
- 🥕 was vegan
