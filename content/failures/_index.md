**Why did I make a failures page?**

When I first started university, I was very insecure about my abilities. I would assume everyone achieved success on their first try, while I seemed to swim in failures. But this isn't true, and unfortunately, we tend to focus on our unpleasant experiences (like failures) more than our pleasant experiences (successes). Essentially, this section of my website serves as a reminder to myself and those read it that failures and not knowing things are normal.

I also read others' failure resumes and it helps me alot, so I hope my failure resume can help you too.

Failures are subjective. What seems like a failure to me might not to you. I also recognize that I'm fortunate to have opportunities to fail and learn.

## 2021
- My request to return to the Health team at Microsoft was rejected.
- Messed up my sleep schedule and have several health problems occur because of it; I worked overtime while interning at Microsoft.
  - I need to sleep earlier and not continue working or binge watching YouTube into the night. I have a huge headache and sore eyes as of writing this.
- Poorly planned my courses in second year so I didn't get promoted to third year standing.
  - When I found out I was still in second year standing, I read the promotion rules a little more closely and then I realized I was only 0.4 credits away from being promoted to third year. 
- Fell off my running streak.
  - I used to run cross country in junior high and had to stop because of IB in high school. I had finally gotten into a good habit. Unfortunately, I had to stop running due to wisdom teeth extraction.
- I got a C in a Environmental Microbiology.
  - I initally said that I disliked the course content. But after some reflection, now I realize there were many things that led to this low mark. Firstly, the instructor was very distant. No real time lectures meant I procrastinated watching them. Secondly, there were pages and pages to memorize for this course. Pair this with procrastination and you have disaster. The poor delivery of the course AND my poor planning led to my low mark.
- I forgot to apply for UBC iGEM.
  - After rediscovering my love of chemistry, I was SO excited to find a club like UBC iGEM. However, when I opened up the application, I realized that I had put in the deadline date wrong; it was 2 days ago.
- Failed an Organic Chemistry quiz.
  - This one hits hard because I was planning to major in Chemistry, and it was my favorite course in high school. Since I took Chemistry HL as an IB student, I was able to skip first year chemistry, which meant I was quite rusty when I took CHEM 233, more than a year after my IB exams. For the future, I'll make to revisit my foundations!

## 2020
- Didn't get any internships for the summer.
  - This worked out pretty well because I rediscovered my love for chemistry! After taking some biology and chemistry courses during the summer I decided to minor in biochemistry.
