I recently wrote a link:/posts/cs-edu[rant-like post] about
my thoughts on my path to CS. Since then, I’ve been thinking about how I
was first introduced to computer science when I heard the phrase
"Everyone should learn how to code". The more I think about this tech
marketing mantra that has been screamed at me from every coding boot
camp, online MOOC, and even President Obama, the more and more I
disagree with it.

== Does that mean Lucy doesn’t like coding?

This article isn’t saying that we should not teach coding at all. Coding
(or programming) is a mechanism to make a concept in computer science
tangible or realizable. Essentially, it's a skill.
I’ll use a metaphor using concepts in chemistry.
In organic chemistry, you study many reaction mechanisms to understand
why some reactions go forward to produce the desired drug, while other
reactions are futile. But being able to predict which product a reaction
mechanism will produce is different from actually extracting the end
product in a lab. In the lab, you need skills like pipetting, visual
cues, knowledge of proper reactant ratios, how to extract and preserve
the end product (you can’t just leave it in the reactant solution!), and
more. Without these lab skills, it doesn’t matter how good you are at
organic chemistry, because you can’t even make the damn molecule.

Similarly, in the classroom, you might learn about tree traversal
algorithms, the concept of allocating and freeing your memory, and how
to prove your algorithm is correct and will produce the desired output,
much like coming up with a reaction mechanism that produces the drug you
want. But coding this algorithm requires you to understand, given
whatever programming language you use, how to get that programming
language running in the first place, the syntax rules (semicolons or
parens?), how to spot and fix memory leaks, how to spot dangling
pointers and more. Watching a video on pipetting doesn’t make you an
expert at pipetting, just like how watching someone correctly implement
an algorithm in C or Python doesn’t make you an expert coder.

But coding and pipetting are simply skills for different jobs. If you
want to work in a chemistry lab, you will need lab skills. Similarly, if
you want to become a software engineer, you’ll need to code. This
doesn’t mean coding is something everyone needs to learn, just like
everyone doesn’t need to learn how to pipette because not everyone is
not going to be producing drugs or programming applications.

Maybe you argue that coding will become a part of everyone’s jobs, but I
don’t think this will happen. More likely to occur is that computers
will become a part of everyone’s jobs, but people don’t need to know or
understand C to use a computer. This is because software engineers will
hide the coding details away into nice and easy-to-use user interfaces.
When you drag a file into a folder, there is code being executed to
signal to your computer that this file is in a new folder. But you
didn’t have to get down and dirty in the code. All you have to do is use
your mouse to drag the file over.

== How did "Learn to code" come about?

But before I get into why everyone should learn about computers, I
wanted to explore deeper into this "Learn to Code" movement.

=== How "Learn to code" got me into computer science

I have loved chemistry since I was 13, maybe you could have guessed from
the chemistry metaphor. I never cared about getting a high-paying job
until I was applying for universities and realized you couldn’t get paid
much for having a Bachelor’s degree in chemistry. The "Learn to code"
movement caught my eye and I started to believe that coding was the
future.

Phrases like: "Everyone should learn how to code", "Code to become
the next Bill Gates", gave me the impression that coding was a
necessary skill everyone needed to know to succeed in the future, or
else they would fail. I even wrote that "everyone would have to eventually learn how to code to succeed and solve all the problems in the world" in my statement when I applied to UWaterloo (looking back, that was super cringe).

I tossed my dream of pursuing chemistry away and decided to get a degree
in computer science.

== Why is learning to code such a hot topic?

A lot of young people are learning how to code, and the
movement is only growing in strength. I wondered why and came up with
these points:

=== Accessibility

In developed nations, over 80% of householdsfootnote:[https://www.statista.com/statistics/1107826/access-to-computer-in-households-worldwide/[Share of individuals who have access to a computer in their household in 2020, by country]] have a personal computer. This makes coding very accessible, a vast improvement
from the early ages of computers, where a computer filled a giant room
and you had to line up and wait in order to run your code. This is
unlike the other sciences. If you want to try out a chemistry experiment
you read up on, good luck. Unless your high school or local university
has a good supply of chemicals and proper equipment and permits you,
there’s a very slim chance of trying out that chemical experiment. There
are also more consequences if you screw up a chemical reaction, much
less so if you forget a semicolon. Additionally, the learning curve for
HTML is much lower than say physics or chemistry, which requires a good
amount of study before you can run your own experiments.

=== Instant gratification and Tech solutionism

Coding delivers instant gratification, due to its accessibility and a
concept called tech solutionism. It takes seconds to pull up an online
REPL and execute code right in your browser. You don’t even need to
understand the code to have something show up. This makes it seem like
coding is easy, which it really isn’t.

Coding can also feel like a shortcut to solving many problems since
there’s a growing "belief that every problem has a solution based on
technology". Hackathons are such events that encourage this type of
thinking, using challenge prompts like "Best hack that solves a climate
problem", leading hackers to feel lots of instant gratification in
designing an application that they think is helpful, when it’s actually
downright useless or even harmful. There is also an over-emphasis on the
technology being used, with all the time and energy being poured into
choosing which AI model to use or whether to use the blockchain or a
regular database and shifting focus away from the actual problem. Tech
takes many human problems, turning them into tech problems
insteadfootnote:[Race + Data Science Lecture Series: Ali Alkhatib
https://t.co/RM2hBKW4tw[(36:21)]].

Many human problems are complex problems with a deep history. Turning a
human problem into a technical problem may seem like you’re solving the
human problem, but you may end up "misunderstanding a human problem,
introducing a new problem, which shifts the focus and
gatekeeps"footnote:[Race + Data Science Lecture Series: Ali Alkhatib
https://youtu.be/B1v2KIdL5Rs?t=2220[(37:00)]] and causes harm. An
example is a website built by two Harvard students that tried to house
refugees from Ukrainefootnote:[https://gizmodo.com/harvard-students-refugee-housing-website-ukraine-take-s-1848708164[A Website Resettling Ukrainian Refugees Got Adoring Headlines. Experts Say It Was Too Good to Be True.]]. 
What seemed
like a good product was full of security holes and bugs ready for
exploitation. For instance,

____
lax security measures have also exposed the private data of the hosts
opening their homes to refugees, allowing anyone to see information
including hosts’ phone numbers and email addresses with a few clicks.
____

Media also worsened the situation by praising this hacked together
website, shifting focus away from those doing the ground work. Not only
was the product a privacy and security nightmare, but it showed how
clueless it’s creators were about relocating refugees.

____
In an interview with Gizmodo, Chojecka also said she had a problem with
the site’s lack of education about the refugee experience for hosts, the
fact that it did not translate listings into multiple languages, and
that it had listings from places as far away as the U.S.

You would never say other skills like wielding, cooking, or pipetting
could solve all the world’s problems. Why is coding any different from
other skills?

Coding (and technology) has limitations, and many times coding can
introduce problems you would never have with traditional or alternative
methods. You can read about my thoughts on tech solutionism in
hackathons link:/posts/hackathons/#_what_are_we_trying_to_solve_here[here].

=== Marketing

There’s no marketing initiative as strong as "Learn to Code". No one
is marketing "Learn History" or "Learn Chemistry" because a bunch of
people who know history or chemistry don’t serve giant companies well.
By giant companies, I mean tech companies. It’s cheap for a tech company
to produce a MOOC and sell it to people desperate for a better-paying
job. These people with only coding skills are then at the will of large
companies to pick and choose who they want. And with only more and more
people wanting a job in tech, companies can be less competitive with
salaries.

While "Learn to Code" isn’t as common now, there are other marketing
campaigns and initiatives telling us to quickly learn about AI to get a
job in AI or quickly learn about Web3 and get a job in Web3 because iTs
tHe fuTUrE. You rarely ever see this in other areas such as chemistry,
with organic chemistry being cool one year, and materials chemistry
being hot another year. Fast Food
Educationfootnote:[https://www.kernelmag.io/pieces/fast-food-education[Fast
Food Education]] discusses the rise of coding/design boot camps and
their shallow and lacking curriculums, which flood the market with a
bunch of people with the same skills.

== Is teaching everyone to code the right thing to do?

I honestly don't think so. Why are we teaching everyone to code in the first
place? Is it get more minorities into the tech industry? Is it to prepare
people for a digitized future? Is it so that someone can create a coding
bootcamp to earn a few extra bucks? Is it to preapre people for most jobs to
involve a computing component?  Is it so that people can better understand how
technology impacts their lives? Is it so that people learn engage in
computational thinking?

Many organizations and people have different reasons for why everyone must
learn to code or learn about technology. I'll list my two reasons: People
should understand how technology is impacting their lives, and also understand
that _some_ jobs will involve a computing component, with the former being more
important in my opinion.

How can we enable everyone to understand how technology impacts their lives? I
believe we can start with all learning about how computers were first invented
and how a modern computer works. Computers are impacting every single part of
our lives, and many people do not understand how a
link:/posts/computers/#_a_misunderstandinglack_of_understanding_of_a_file_system[file
system] works or how a
link:/posts/computers/#_how_memory_works_in_progress[computers reads and writes
from memory]. To many computers are "magical intelligent pieces of metal". 

Before you learned about physics, chemistry, math, and biology you might
have thought other events were magical, like how baking powder works,
how that weird Möbius paper is a single-sided strip with one edge, and
how sound travels. But through our education, we have all gained some
understanding of how these magical events work; baking powder mixed with
water produces carbon dioxide bubbles (making your muffins fluffy), the
math behind the one-sided paper, and that sound travels in waves. Does
learning to code accomplish one’s desire to understand how a computer
works?

image::/images/learn-to-code/Mobius.jpg[]

No, not always. Coding in high-level languages like Python, JavaScript, or
scripting languages like HTML or CSS does not. This high-level coding is what
is mostly taught by boot camps and current elementary and secondary computer
science curriculums. In fact, another avenue of teaching computer science is to
teach about computatinal thinking. Programs that teach web development seldom
touch on this idea of computational thinking.

Teaching computational thinking can enable people to apply this type of
thinking into other activities, like their jobs. While this sounds great,
transfer learning is actually more difficult to achieve than you think. Another
path is to teach link:/posts/notes/2022-05-05-sicp-vs-htdp[HTDP], which teaches
students to design programs using explicit design rules. Many other areas of
science include these "explict" rules, such
as balancing chemistry equations.

While teaching web development is a way to express creativity through online
formats, too often web development is conflated with computer science. This
creates a wrong impression of what computer science is! Programming is also
conflated with computer science, which claos creates the flawed idea that
computer science is only about programming, when it's closer to math.

== End

Teaching only code is like only teaching someone lab skills. Of course,
someone will eventually discover which two reactants will produce the
desired product by trial and error, but they will have a lacking
understanding of why a chemical reaction works. As the saying goes;
"Give a Man a Fish, and You Feed Him for a Day. Teach a Man To Fish,
and You Feed Him for a Lifetime".

Because let’s face it; what goes up must always come down. Teaching
skills today does not always mean these skills will be useful in the
future. Tech has gone through many big booms; first C, Java, JavaScript,
AI, and now Web3. Who knows what is next? But something that will stick
with us for a long time is the
