From my chemistry professor [Dr. Perrin](https://perrin.chem.ubc.ca/about-dr-perrin/):
> After a lot of thought, doing undergraduate research, and taking graduate courses in chemistry, I opted to make molecules because if I ever gave that up, I could always make money whereas if I chose the money option, I would never have a chance to make a molecule.

In high school, I faced a similar question. Pursue my passion in chemistry or choose the "safe" route of an employable and high-paying degree like computer science. For the first two years of university, I chose the money route. But this year I had some doubts with my choices.
