Here are 5 things that happened this month:

1. Ran another eventful iteration of StarHacks II.
2. Got denied a combined major in Computer Science and Biochemistry.
3. Due to my constant flip flopping between courses, I started out with 5 courses and ended up with 3.
4. Got better than I thought on CPSC 213
5. Ate lots of curry
