Who would of thought that my first internship would take place in my childhood bedroom? <!-- more --> Definitely not me. Even less did I think I would end up:
- writing 6000 lines of Python
- being part of a research paper

- presenting my work to a group of very talented people, all of which I look up to

But not everything was *great*. I also ended up:

- getting horrible headaches and super dry eyes
- multitasking (when I really shouldn't be)
- feeling unqualified at times
