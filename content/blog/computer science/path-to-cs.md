When I was in my first year of university, I started to believe that I wasted my time in high school; I wished that I started learning about computer science sooner. I had invested a lot of time into chemistry in high school and then pivoted to majoring in computer science in university. These two subjects don't have much in relation at all. It seemed like while everyone else (in computer science) was learning about AI and web development, I was busy learning chemistry and other IB-related things (English IB HL people know how tough this course was).

By the end of my first year, I was utterly confused. In class, we learned about graph traversals, proofs, and logic, but I kept hearing everyone talk about doing "Full Stack" development. So I decided to learn more about that and had a horrible time learning about it. I wasn't interested in HTML or JavaScript, and I didn't want to build websites; this lead me to believe that computer science was just building websites! I did some hackathons and tried learning stuff over the summer, but nothing stuck and I began to feel like this wasn't the path I wanted to take in university.

At the beginning of my second year, I was thinking of switching my major (which was currently in computer science) and going for a major in chemistry. That's when I started taking more chemistry and health science courses. And being in those chemistry classes was a fresh of breath air for me; no one talked about JavaScript, internships, or side projects. There was occasional talk about undergrad research, but the environment in health science classes was less stifling for me than computer science classes. 

I think a reason for this is because everyone in health science classes had more or less the same amount of knowledge. First and second-year chemistry classes were enjoyable for me because I had taken Chemistry IB HL. Biology, biochemistry, and microbiology classes were enjoyable for me because I had the same basis of biology and chemistry as everyone else. I didn't feel like I was very "behind" in the same way that I did in computer science classes. In my organic chemistry class, we were collectively confused, which is a nice feeling to have vs. being the only one confused.

In computer science, many of my classmates (mostly men) had already started programming in high school. They talked among themselves about topics I didn't understand and were able to easily answer in-class questions. It felt like a club I was shut out of because I wasn't spending time in high school programming. But when the midterm mark distribution came out, I was never terribly below average; sometimes above, and sometimes just average. So why did I always feel intimidated and out of place? 

I'm not sure. But now in my third year, I'm no longer sad that I wasn't coding away during high school because I enjoyed my time in high school. Chemistry will always be something I love. For the longest time, I couldn't justify taking courses in chemistry or biochemistry in university because I thought I should only spend money on courses that had better a return. Wouldn't it be better to spend money on a computer science course that could allow me to make more money, than a chemistry course that I was just interested in? I had this mindset for the first two years of my undergrad degree.This resulted in me flip-flopping between courses (never having a good timetable) and choosing courses that "sounded good", rather than if I actually wanted to learn about the topic. Eventually, I realized that I was wasting more time trying to force myself to like some courses; what would happen if I took that organic chemistry course instead of the databases course? Hopefully, nothing much, because I'm in that organic chemistry course right now. Additionally, I've found out that I'm interested in programming languages (how they are designed) and operating systems/compilers (how that programming language is turned into assembly and how hardware and software communicate with each other). So I don't think I'll be taking that database course.


# Why I no longer wish that I did computer science in high school
One large reason I never ventured into computer science in high school was that I didn't have good resources near me. Out of all the women in my IB class, only 2 (including me) decided to not do a degree in the health sciences. In my daily life, no one I talked to talked about computer science. 

One reason why I loved chemistry is that I had a wealth of resources near me to foster that passion. I started learning about orbitals in junior high and hand drew a periodic table that has hung in my room for 8 years. My father (who also shares the same passion for chemistry) actively encouraged my interests and gave me resources so I could self-learn at a young age. Additionally, the Science 10 (and junior high) curriculum had chemistry integrated into it, so I didn't have to do much self-directed learning once I entered high school. I also had friends I could talk to about chemistry, a teacher who was passionate about teaching chemistry, and an advanced curriculum in chemistry thanks to IB that went above and beyond the Alberta high school chemistry curriculum.

On the other hand, I didn't have any external factors for pursuing computer science. The computer science program at my high school in Calgary was unbeknownst to me (I didn't know if they had a computer science program at the time), my parents never really mentioned computer science to me, and no one around me was talking about computer science. I had never learned about computer science or even had it mentioned to me until my last year of high school, which was when computer science became the next hottest thing. 

I was scared that a major in chemistry would result in a futile career, which is why I decided to major in computer science. I don't like that this was the reason for me to set foot into computer science, but I'm glad this is no longer the reason that I'm staying. There are many reasons why I'm staying:

- computers can help us in many other areas, like drug research and DNA sequencing!
- the way computers work is very interesting; it's both fragile and robust, like the way our bodies work. Crazy stuff.
- I like knowing exactly how something works. This is a reason why I'm interested in low-level computing/compiler/operating systems. Lots of abstractions hide the ugly details, but I like to know those ugly details.

Many university courses helped me realize those reasons why I'm staying in computer science; CPSC 110 and CPSC 213. Not only did I enjoy the content, but the professors inspired me and interested me!

CPSC 110 taught me so many concepts I didn't even know I was learning.
- I learned about data structures like graphs without even knowing I was
- I learned about linked lists without even knowing I was
- I learned about graph traversals
- I learned about program design
- I learned about test-driven development
- I learned about abstraction

CPSC 213 was the course that FINALLY allowed me to understand:
- pointers
- how code becomes understandable to a computer
- how and why a stack overflow can occur from too many recursive calls
- why we care about memory usage

I'm excited about higher-level courses, and to also combine what I will learn in computer science with chemistry and biochemistry. I don't think learning computer science in high school would have resulted in where I am today. Taking my first computer science in university from a world-renown professor who tailored the course for years, has shaped the way I think about programming and computer science differently; I think about code in a more functional paradigm than an imperative paradigm. The computer science curriculum at my high school touches on OOP concepts and imperative programming before recursion and functional programming concepts. I'm glad I was introduced to functional programming concepts before imperative ones because this has made learning concepts in other classes much easier. The way a university lays out its computer science curriculum is more thought out than a high school one (I think, at least in high schools from Calgary), so this is also another reason I no longer regret how I spent my time in high school (learning about things I liked).
