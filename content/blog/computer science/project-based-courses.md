*Disclaimer: I'm not a professor, just a student and teaching assistant for the course I will be talking about, so I will be talking about my experices, both as a student and teaching assistant*

It can be easy to see societal applications or feel a personal connection to the natural sciences. For instance, in biology, you learn about the cells inside of you, which is pretty personal. In chemistry, you learn how to synthesize drugs, which can be seen as positively impacting society by creating life saving therapies to treat diseases. These two reasons I mentioned above may be what compel someone to study a natural science. 

However, this the link between computer science and society, or computer science and yourself is harder to see. In fact, the lower ratio between women and men in computer science can be partially be explained by the idea that computer science doesn't have a positive impact on [society](TODO). I experienced this myself in my first programming course. 

# Programming
The first computer science course you take will almost 100% have a programming component. In [Critically Conscience Computing](TODO), Amy J. Ko, PhD talks about several ways programming is usually taught, and the positives and negatives between the different methods. The most common, consistent and probably easiest way to evaluate someone's programming excellence is through problem sets. 

## Problem Sets
After students go to lecture, they must practice the knowledge they have learned. Simply reading or watching someone code does not imply a student can also code. A way to evaluate a student's ability to program is through problem sets. Problems sets are an easy way for an instructor to see a student's ability to code because problem sets can be issued after every lecture, or some consistent time interval, with questions targeting specific concepts or lectures. 

Since students will all do the same problem set, this ensures some level of fairness, since all students will be answering the same problems. However, as CCC mentions, problems sets may be divorced from someone's life. Most problem set questions may involve questions like "Traverse a tree numbers" or "Generate all the possible outcomes for a set of clowns". If a student is not intrinsically already interested in computer science, these type of questions in problem sets are usually divergent from a student's personal interests, and may make them less interested in computer science as a whole. In fact, I experienced this same feeling. I couldn't see or understand how these problem sets would give me skills to contribute positively to society.

While problem sets ensure a student is up to a standard of knowledge (if they can complete the problem set correctly, this means they have understood most of the material), they can feel rigid and impersonal to a student. A solution to this is to center a course around being project based.

## Project based courses
Project based courses aim to offer a personalised and individualised component for the student. Student's can conceptualize their own project, usually adhering to some rules that require using a certain programming language or implementing concepts like object orientated design.
