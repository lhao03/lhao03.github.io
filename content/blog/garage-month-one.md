This summer, I'm a software engineer intern at the Microsoft Garage! For everyone's reference, the Microsoft Garage is 

> The Garage is a community of interns, employees, and teams from across the company who come together to turn their passion into projects. It’s also the official outlet for experimental projects from Microsoft. We use this outlet to get our intern created apps in the hands of customers for fast feedback and continuous improvement.

And now on to the 5 things I've learned as an intern at the Microsoft Garage in my first month.

## Don't go to every meeting
The first week of the garage internship is all meetings, but after that meetings become optional. There's large FOMO when you're an intern, so you might try to go to every single meeting. However, if you're going to every single meeting, you're not going to have any time to write code and make PRs. So PLEASE only go to meeting that you feel will benefit you or that you will add input to. Always make a list of questions or have a goal in mind when attending a meeting. 

With virtual meetings, it's easy to say "I'll just stay in the background and get some coding down in this meeting". But whenever I try to do that, I either get absorbed in the meeting or absorbed in my coding OR just hella distracted and don't understand what's going on in the meeting or my code. [Multitasking is a myth](https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=95256794).

## Use your intern card and don't forget you're an intern
You're only an intern for 12-16 weeks at a time, so use that to your advantage! Have a question? Slap the "I'm an intern..". Wanna meet someone building a tool your're super interested in? Slap the "I'm an intern...". When employees see that you're an intern, a few things go through their mind. 

A. This person has a limited timeline: they understand you're gonna be gone in like 4 weeks, so they understand the urgency of your request. 

B. This person is a student learning about the tech industry: they know that you probably don't know much about the tech industry, AND most people love to talk about their experiences, and this is an advantage to a intern! Learn all you can; I've talked to a mananger buliding cloud services for healthcare, a finance mananger, a developer building Microsoft Learn, a PM working on embedded extensions, and much more. 

C. I was once an intern and I would of loved to have ...: When I mentor students in high school, the main motivating factor behind it is because "I wish I had this type of mentorship when I was in high school". People love to give back, especially at Microsoft. In fact, many full time employees signed up as mentors, coffee chats and coaches for my internship. 

So if you ask for that coffee chat or that question, 11/10 times that employee will say yes, unless they are busy.

And don't forget that you're an intern. You're supposed to write bad code, learn new things and meet new people. So go do that!

## You will run in walls and you will break them down
In every software development project, there are things that are beyond your control. Our team has had to reach out to people from Kenya, Seattle, India and more to take the smallest steps forward. We have had to change our MVP multiple times due to changing customer demands, recieving more information, or realizing we had the wrong information. The first time we hit a wall we all took a hit in morale. But now we view it as a challenge, because believe it or not, we (and you) will always find a way. It might not be the way you envisioned or liked, but there is always a way.

## I'm horrible at using {{ inline(text="git")}} in a team setting
Yup, I'm bad at using {{ inline(text="git")}} in a team setting. When I use git by myself, I usually commit very mindlessly and very often. This became apparent when I made a PR and saw that I had made 35 commits for only a few code changes. Frankly, I was a bit embarrassed to see how messy my git history was. I also messed up merging some branches (if you worked with me, you probably remember me spamming the chat about the mess I made). But I took it as a learning oppertunity and now I'll take some industry standard git courses. 

## It doesn't matter that you don't know React and Redux and TypeScript (or any programming language/framework/library) 
The programming languages I knew going into the internship were Python, Java and the smallest bits and pieces of Haskell and Go. Did I use any of these programming languages? Nope. I'm using React, Redux and TypeScript if anyone is interested. With that being said, don't stress about what skills you're lacking and trying to speed run a JavaScript tutorial. For most interns, you spend the first 1-3 weeks just learning. I took a course on React and Redux, and skipped the TypeScript training because I felt like it was better for me to learn on the go. Even full time employees will have "learning" or "training" periods in which they spend a week or so learning about new technologies. And tech companies know that {{ inline(text="giving employees time to learn === employees can adopt the latest technologies and build stuff with it. === more money for company")}}. For instance, Google has a [20% project time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20%25_Project) where they let employees do whatever they want!

I decided to include one extra tip, because of how unique the Garage internship is from more tradditional internships.

## We're all interns here
What is unique about the Garage program is that you get to work with 6 other interns. This means as a team of interns, we get to do sprint planning, MVP planning, customer research, and more. And since we are all interns, it means many of us have never done all the things I just listed. Some interns may have done customer research before while others have some experience in sprint planning. Or if you're me, you have done neither 😎. That means we can all learn something from each other and that sometimes we have to learn together. So use that to your advantage! Set up sessions to ask each other questions on React and Redux (like we did) and send each other learning resources! 

If the garage internship sounds cool to you, hit me up and I'll answer any questions you have!
