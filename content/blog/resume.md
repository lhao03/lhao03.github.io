Since starting university, my resume has gone through many edits and changes. I want to discess what I liked and didn't like about all my previous resumes, and how I came to my current one. Below are 3 versions of resumes that I used extensively to apply to internships. The order of the resumes is random. Don't worry, I'll zoom in on each resume when I talk about each one.
