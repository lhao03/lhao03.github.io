In the summer of 2020, I switched to Ubuntu Budgie for a short period time. After some hardware issues, I reverted back to Windows. Well, this summer of 2021, I'm back to try to use Linux again. Some differences:

I'll be dual booting. There's some things on Windows, like the better touchscreen support, that I use time to time. Additionally, if anything ever happens on my Linux setup, I can go back to my Windows setup. 

I'll be trying out Pop!_OS this time. For anyone else reading this, I have a HP Spectre 360x.
