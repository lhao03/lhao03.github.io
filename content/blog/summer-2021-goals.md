## improving on things I already do
Since gyms are closed, I want to start running more seriously now. Something that alot of weight lifters (including me) do is neglect their cardiovascular health. In addition to running, I'm going to plan out calisthenics workouts and follow them religiously. My goal is to get to 10 consecutive pullups and to run 6 miles in one go by the end of the summer. As of writing this, I can do 5 pullups in a row and run just under 3 miles without stopping.
