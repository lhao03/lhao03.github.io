# who am i
I’m loud  
*Too loud, and sent to sit in the back of the classroom*

I’m disruptive  
*I'm told I can't play on the park and to stand beside my teacher for recess*

I’m blunt and honest  
*I'm scolded for saying another student smelled bad (that student really did smell bad) and told to leave the classroom* 

I talk to everyone  
*But no one replies because I don't look like them*

Math is easy  
*I finish my homework quickly and always get 100*

I decide to be mute  
*I either get in trouble or no response when I talk, so what's the point?*

I decide to be alone   
*I take walks during lunch and talk to no one in class*

I have to weigh less than 100 lbs   
*I skip breakfast and lunch, and go to sleep right after dinner*

I try the Vegan, paleo, and raw diet  
*My hair falls out, I lose my period, I'm shivering in 20 C weather*

I run   
*I run away from my thoughts and to run off the calories*

I love chemistry  
*Molecules are everywhere and make up everything; chemistry saves me from my eating disorder*

I can lift more than 200 lbs  
*The more I eat, the stronger I get, and the more I can lift*

Math is too hard now  
*The top student in my math class tells me women can't do math; I stop trying to do math*

I love teaching  
*I talk to the students and help students as best as I can*

It’s better to be quiet  
*Not everyone deserves my thoughts*

It’s better to be a pessimist   
*Prepare myself for the worst; because the worst has happened*

It’s always my fault  
*The blame falls on me, it's easier to apologize*

I’m always a giver   
*I run myself over doing other people's tasks*

I’m always daydreaming   
*I imagine I'm in a different world*

I always doubt myself  
*I've lost so many parts of myself, conformed to so many external pressures that I doubt who I am*

I'm 21  
*As a lost and quiet as my 18 year old self, but never as loud and imaginative as my 10 year old self*
