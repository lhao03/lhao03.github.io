After three years in university, I finally came to my senses and changed my major to a combined major in Computer Science and Chemistry. I also dropped all extra curricular activities that no longer aligned with my values and interests. But why has it taken three years? And why did I have so much difficulty in making these changes?

# using my time
I think my values about a lot of things have changed since I first entered university. For instance, my stance computer science/technology, on hackathons, how to engage more minorities in computer science, what I wanted to do with my life, and more. 

## my stance on computer science and technology
When I first started university with the intention of majoring in computer science, I had no idea what computer science was. My high school wasn't really in a tech hotspot and none of my friends were doing computer science. They were all doing pre-med programs. I sometimes wonder what would of happened if I did pre-med. I probably would have gone to UofC. But I didn't really want to do pre-med; I wanted to do chemistry. But my dad warned me that it would be hard to get a high paying job as a chemistry undergraduate. 

Up until my last year of university, I knew I was going to major in chemistry. I didn't think about job prospects or money, mainly because my parents didn't talk about jobs that much, and they didn't let me know anything about money. My parents didn't nag me to become a doctor or an engineer, and any money I earned I just gave to my parents to manage. I was largely disconnected with the real world, until it was time to apply to universities. 

My parents started to bombard me with information on money, living alone, and jobs. And suddenly, I became really worried about how I was going to earn money as an adult. What would I do with a chemistry degree? Can you live off a chemistry degree? My dad told me his story, a chemistry student pursuing a PhD who had trouble providing for his family with the salary of a grad student. He then pivoted into software and that was his story. I'm largely influenced by my father. We have similar interests and similar worldviews. So it was natural for me to also pivot to computer science. 

I chose UBC because of their computer science program. As someone who had no idea what computer science was, I tried to learn about it. I went to hackathons, learned about the hottest trends and did side projects. I was the stereotypical computer science student. I listened to what other people had to say, about how AI was the solution to all our problems, which companies paid the most to interns, and what web technologies were the shiniest. I thought computer science was awesome. AI was amazing, hackathons gave so much free food and swag and you could build awesome side projects on your own. Computer science had an easiness to it. It was easy to love AI because everyone was talking about it. It was easy to activate your reward centers with the free food and swag at hackathons. It was easy to think you actually did something useful with all those shitty side projects you built.

This easiness is what chemistry lacks. No one would let a bunch of chemistry students into a lab to concoct up an experiment of a "drug that cures everything". No one would give you free food and swag for doing so. So that's how I justified that I liked computer science. The easiness of it. 

Of course, that didn't last. In fact, I'm disgusted by what I thought was amazing in my first year of university. Firstly, I have a huge dislike for [hackathons](@/blog/compsci/hackathons.md) now. I used to organize hackathons, and stopped this year because of how hackathons clashed with my vales. What I hated most about hackathons was the technosolution. At every demo table I'd witness an improper use of technology on a large societal problem. And these were the projects were awarded thousands of dollars. Fun games that had eye-catching graphics never won any awards, no matter how well they were designed and programmed. A project that was duct-tapped together with copy-pasted code from the internet, which claimed more than any application could ever do, were the projects that were winners at hackathons. I was so disgusted over how people could just claim their project solved a problem in the world. How "easy" it seemed to be to find a technical solution to any problem. 

{{ quote(text="It's funny how a microbiology class fundamentally changed the way I went about thinking about solving problems. In MICB 202, I learned about cholera, an acute diarrhoeal infection caused by ingesting water or food contaminated with the bacterium Vibrio cholerae. How would one go about reducing the number of cases of cholera? Well, by cleaning up the water. But how? Using chemicals? Using energy to kill off bacteria? While these are solutions, there's one thing we are forgetting about: the context of the problem, and those who are actually affected. The context is that the location (Bangladeshi villages) where cholera is still an issue is in places where water is used for everything, usually not being filtered or cleaned before the water is used. The water that people use to drink is also used for washing. So you can't just dump chemicals into the rivers and hope for the best. Additionally, there's a lack of resources. Who's going to synthesize chemicals and where would you even purify the water? Even boiling water would be a strain on resources (it would be better to use firewood for heating or cooking). To someone that is unfamiliar with the context of the issue, it's easy to slap a solution together and actually cause more harm than good.

So what was the solution the researchers came up with? The solution is quite simple and is a solution that can be easily adopted and pushed out into the public. It was to use a sari, a piece of cloth worn by Hindu women, but also now frequently worn by women of other religious groups. This solution is one I didn't even think of when my professor presented the case study in class. Why? Well because I didn't have a good or even basic understanding of the context of the problem, such as the cultural practices.",

I stopped organizing two hackathons this year, StarHacks and the trio of hackathons hosted by nwPlus. Hackathons had a similarity with the fast paced nature of Silicon Valley, grabbing at every trend possible, awarding money to people who promised elaborate solutions that eventually fell flat. Hackathons were easy. Easy to feel like you understand technology and easy to feel like technology is all good and powerful.

And now that influenced how I viewed computer science and technology. In first year, I remember thinking "how am I supped to keep up with all the trends?". I took some online courses on AI, because that's what I thought I should do. I also tried to build a "full-stack project" with MERN or whatever the hottest tech stack was, because that's what I thought I should do.

# degree dilemmas
Lots of students change their majors. But chemistry wasn't just "chemistry". It was the subject area that I, and my dad, am and still is passionate about. The difference is that my dad didn't get to pursue his dreams and passions. He had to pivot to the software industry, which was booming at the time I was about to be born. His dreams and passions could not support his family. So in a way, it feels almost wrong, for me, his daughter, to pursue her dreams and passions, which were so similar to his. I struggled with these thoughts a lot. I was also scared that doing a degree in chemistry would lead me to a bleak future. I saw how undergraduate chemistry and biology majors struggled to find a job while computer science majors could easily get an internship paying five times more than a lab assistant. So I became a computer science major, but I still wanted to do *something* that had chemistry. I still wanted to learn about chemistry.

So what did I do? I tried out everything *but* chemistry. I did courses in biology, microbiology and biochemistry. But none of them clicked. Every time my biology, microbiology or biochemistry professor mentioned something about chemistry in relation to a lecture topic I was so excited. But it would only be for a few minutes. I soon realised that the parts of courses I liked the most were the parts in which the professor made some connection to chemistry. 

# molecules or money?
Something from my chemistry professor [Dr. Perrin](https://perrin.chem.ubc.ca/about-dr-perrin/) that I think a lot about:
> I opted to make molecules because if I ever gave that up, I could always make money whereas if I chose the money option, I would never have a chance to make a molecule.

I'm still unsure of what I want to do in the future. Pursue my passion in chemistry or choose the "safe" route of a high-paying career as a software developer.
