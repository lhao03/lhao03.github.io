After three years in university, I finally came to my senses and changed my major to a combined major in Computer Science and Chemistry. But why has it taken three years? And why did I have so much difficulty in just changing my major to include chemistry?

Lots of students change their majors. But chemistry wasn't just "chemistry". It was the subject area that I, and my dad, am and still is passionate about. The difference is that my didn't get to pursue his dreams and passions. He had to pivot to the software industry, which was booming at the time I was about to be born. His dreams and passions could not support his family. So in a way, it feels almost wrong, for me, his daughter, to pursue her dreams and passions, which were so similar to his. I struggled with these thoughts a lot. So what did I do? I tried out everything *but* chemistry. I did courses in biology, microbiology and biochemistry. But none of them clicked. Every my biology, microbiology or biochemistry professor mentioned something about chemistry in relation to a lecture topic I was so excited. But it would only be for a few minutes. I soon realised that the parts of courses I liked the most were the parts in which the professor made some connection to chemistry. 

Something from my chemistry professor [Dr. Perrin](https://perrin.chem.ubc.ca/about-dr-perrin/) that I think a lot about:
> I opted to make molecules because if I ever gave that up, I could always make money whereas if I chose the money option, I would never have a chance to make a molecule.

I'm still unsure of what I want to do in the future. Pursue my passion in chemistry or choose the "safe" route of a high-paying career as a software developer.
