After three years in university, I finally came to my senses and changed my major to a combined major in Computer Science and Chemistry. I also dropped all extra curricular activities that no longer aligned with my values and interests. But why has it taken three years? And why did I have so much difficulty in making these changes?

# my values 
I think my values about a lot of things have changed since I first entered university. For instance, my stance computer science/technology, on hackathons, what I wanted to do with my life, and more. 

## my stance on computer science and technology
When I first started university with the intention of majoring in computer science, I had no idea what computer science was. My high school wasn't really in a tech hotspot and none of my friends were doing computer science. They were all doing pre-med programs. I sometimes wonder what would of happened if I did pre-med. I probably would have gone to UofC. But I didn't really want to do pre-med; I wanted to do chemistry. But my dad warned me that it would be hard to get a high paying job as a chemistry undergraduate. 

Up until my last year of university, I knew I was going to major in chemistry. I didn't think about job prospects or money, mainly because my parents didn't talk about jobs that much, and they didn't let me know anything about money. My parents didn't nag me to become a doctor or an engineer, and any money I earned I just gave to my parents to manage. I was largely disconnected with the real world, until it was time to apply to universities. 

My parents started to bombard me with information on money, living alone, and jobs. And suddenly, I became really worried about how I was going to earn money as an adult. What would I do with a chemistry degree? Can you live off a chemistry degree? My dad told me his story, a chemistry student pursuing a PhD who had trouble providing for his family with the salary of a grad student. He then pivoted into software and that was his story. I'm largely influenced by my father. We have similar interests and similar worldviews. So it was natural for me to also pivot to computer science. 

I chose UBC because of their computer science program. As someone who had no idea what computer science was, I tried to learn about it. I went to hackathons, learned about the hottest trends and did side projects. I was the stereotypical computer science student. I listened to what other people had to say, about how AI was the solution to all our problems, which companies paid the most to interns, and what web technologies were the shiniest. I thought computer science was awesome. AI was amazing, hackathons gave so much free food and swag and you could build awesome side projects on your own. Computer science had an easiness to it. It was easy to love AI because everyone was talking about it. It was easy to activate your reward centers with the free food and swag at hackathons. It was easy to think you actually did something useful with all those shitty side projects you built.

This easiness is what chemistry lacks. No one would let a bunch of chemistry students into a lab to concoct up an experiment of a "drug that cures everything". No one would give you free food and swag for doing so. So that's how I justified that I liked computer science. The easiness of it. 

Of course, that didn't last. In fact, I'm disgusted by what I thought was amazing in my first year of university. Firstly, I have a huge dislike for [hackathons](@/blog/compsci/hackathons.md) now. I used to organize hackathons, and stopped this year because of how [hackathons clashed with my values](/blog/me/experience/#other-experience). What I hate most about hackathons was the technosolution and techno-utopian hype. At every demo table I'd witness an improper use of technology on a large societal problem. A project what was a website housing a quiz to diagnose you for an eating disorder still haunts me today. I remember going through the quiz and becoming more and more angry at how reductive the questions were. And these were the projects were awarded thousands of dollars; trying to replace therapists with AI powered mental health, or trying to replace doctors with AI, and more. Fun games with breathtaking graphics and immersive story lines never won any awards, no matter how well they were designed and programmed. I'd rather play a game than have AI decide if I have an eating disorder. A project that was duct-tapped together with copy-pasted code from the internet, which claimed more than any application could ever do, were the projects that were winners at hackathons. I was so disgusted over how people could just claim their project solved a problem in the world. How "easy" it seemed to be to find a technical solution to any problem. 

{{ quote(text="It's funny how a microbiology class fundamentally changed the way I went about thinking about solving problems. In MICB 202, I learned about cholera, an acute diarrhoeal infection caused by ingesting water or food contaminated with the bacterium Vibrio cholerae. How would one go about reducing the number of cases of cholera? Well, by cleaning up the water. But how? Using chemicals? Using energy to kill off bacteria? While these are solutions, there's one thing we are forgetting about: the context of the problem, and those who are actually affected. The context is that the location (Bangladeshi villages) where cholera is still an issue is in places where water is used for everything, usually not being filtered or cleaned before the water is used. The water that people use to drink is also used for washing. So you can't just dump chemicals into the rivers and hope for the best. Additionally, there's a lack of resources. Who's going to synthesize chemicals and where would you even purify the water? Even boiling water would be a strain on resources (it would be better to use firewood for heating or cooking). To someone that is unfamiliar with the context of the issue, it's easy to slap a solution together and actually cause more harm than good.

So what was the solution the researchers came up with? The solution is quite simple and is a solution that can be easily adopted and pushed out into the public. It was to use a sari, a piece of cloth worn by Hindu women, but also now frequently worn by women of other religious groups. This solution is one I didn't even think of when my professor presented the case study in class. Why? Well because I didn't have a good or even basic understanding of the context of the problem, such as the cultural practices.",

[I stopped organizing two hackathons](@/blog/life/leaving-extrac.md) this year, StarHacks and the trio of hackathons hosted by nwPlus. Hackathons had a similarity with the fast paced nature of Silicon Valley, grabbing at every trend possible, awarding money to people who promised elaborate solutions that eventually fell flat. Hackathons were easy. Easy to feel like you understand technology and easy to feel like technology is all good and powerful. Easy to become entranced with the values and goals of Silicon Valley.

Hackathons greatly influenced how I viewed computer science and technology. In first year, I remember thinking "how am I supped to keep up with all the trends?". I took some online courses on AI, because that's what I thought I should do. I also tried to build a "full-stack project" with MERN or whatever the hottest tech stack was, because that's what I thought I should do.

At the end of my first year of university I decided that I was done with computer science. I started to feel something like this: 

{{ quote(text="“If someone stays in the major, it’s usually because they have strong peer connections,” she says. “When they leave, it’s not because they’re not capable, but it’s typically because they have this idea that CS does not contribute to the social good, and they want to help people.”",

I didn't have many friends, and I didn't like constantly being confused about what was hot and what I was supposed to learn. AI? Web Dev? Additionally, many of my courses were very abstract. The abstract nature of computer science courses didn't put me off; in fact, I love theory. But I kept wondering why I was spending my time learning about things I wasn't really interested in like web development. Everyone was telling me to learn vocational skills because school was "too theory based". Well if you wanted more application then you should of went to a university that has computer science under engineering (UBC has computer science under science. Anyways.). I've never really been interested in web development. But that was everyone other computer science was doing. 

The root of the problem was that I didn't know *anything* about what computer science was. I knew chemistry had many subareas like organic chemistry, analytical chemistry, theoretical chemistry, etc. and I had a basic understanding of what each of these subareas were about. I didn't know about any subareas of computer science. I thought computer science was *only* AI and web development. I'd complain to my boyfriend "I don't wanna do AI or web development" and he'd say "then don't". But I didn't know what else there was in computer science. I had no idea what you learned in the algorithms and data structures course, the computer systems course, and basically every computer science course offered. I had spent my first two years of university doing what I thought everyone wanted me to do, which was mainly people who were in computer science for the goal of getting a job in big tech. And that's what I thought was *useful* for my future; to get a job in big tech. If lots of people were doing that then it must be useful? Right? 

On the other hand, my boyfriend just learned and studied whatever he wanted to. He dove into the world of ML languages (and no not machine learning) like Haskell. He learned about things everyone told him "wasn't useful for getting a job at Google/Amazon/BigTech". And he didn't care at all. He's one of my largest motivators and inspirations and why I said fuck it and registered into organic chemistry one day before the drop deadline this year. 

Anyways, I'm not too fond of corporate tech industry either. Hackathons were my first exposure to tech companies, and my internship at Microsoft solidified how much I detested the tech industry. I was shocked how much interns got paid for doing seemingly useless work. Yes, the work I did during my internship was useless to. At my first research job applying NLP on extracting data from health documents, my salary was 3500 CAD a month, with 75% of that subsidized through a biotechnology grant. My work was intellectually stimulating and I worked with amazing and passionate people. At Microsoft, my salary was 5000 CAD a month, my work bored me to my wits, and I had to work with collogues who I despised and I later realised were only here for the money. The other interns I worked with at Microsoft would exhibit macho heroics and other tech bro behaviour, leaving me so frustrated on the last day of my internship I decided that no matter how much I was going to be paid I would not accept my return offer. My return offer to Microsoft was 7000 (or 7500, can't remember) USD to their Bellevue campus.

Obviously, the tech industry has a lot of money. And that money is funding a lot of software that exhibits the same air that the projects do at hackathons. Tech billionaires throwing money at technology to solve problems they have no understanding in. Venture capitalists throwing money at AI and Web3, hoping it does some jack shit. Instead, people have been, and are being exploited ([AI exploiting people](https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/04/20/1050392/ai-industry-appen-scale-data-labels/) and [Web3 exploiting people](https://web3isgoinggreat.com/)). I'm troubled and disgusted with some areas of the tech industry. I became, and still am, largely inspired by folks like [Timnit](https://twitter.com/timnitGebru), [Ali Alkhatib](https://twitter.com/_alialkhatib), [Amy J. Ko](https://twitter.com/amyjko), [Emily M. Bender](https://twitter.com/emilymbender) and [Stephen Diehl](https://twitter.com/smdiehl), who are doing work to hold the tech industry accountable.

Even though the tech industry is pretty bad, I eventually came to really like computer science. Specifically, the areas of programming languages and systems like compilers and operating systems. My fascination started when I took CPSC 213, and [Critically Conscious Computing](https://criticallyconsciouscomputing.org/) by [Amy J. Ko](https://twitter.com/amyjko) helped me realise how amazing programming languages and operating systems were. I wouldn't have thought I'd be interested in something like an operating system. In fact, many upper year computer science students said they dreaded every second of the third year computer hardware and operating systems; for me, it's one of my favorite computer science courses. 

At the end of my third year, I think the dust has finally settled down. I no longer try to learn what's "trending" and I do not touch web development. That full-stack app I mentioned I was going to make never happened, and never will. 

Maybe you're reading and thinking that whatever I've said it very confusing or just typical "young adult" thinking. I think what Amy J. Ko says in [Critically Conscious Computing](https://criticallyconsciouscomputing.org/) says sums up my thoughts nicely.

{{ quote(text="Society has not yet broadly decided to make programmers responsible for their code and its impact, and until it does, making room for algorithmic justice will require personal and organizational will.",

Currently, not much personal or organizational will exists, and that troubles me. 

# degree dilemmas
Lots of students change their majors. But chemistry wasn't just "chemistry" for me. It was the subject area that I, and my dad, am and still is passionate about. The difference is that my dad didn't get to pursue his dreams and passions. He had to pivot to the software industry, which was booming at the time I was about to be born. His dreams and passions could not support his family. So in a way, it feels almost wrong, for me, his daughter, to pursue her dreams and passions, which were so similar to his. I struggled with these thoughts a lot. I was also scared that doing a degree in chemistry would lead me to a bleak future. I saw how undergraduate chemistry and biology majors struggled to find a job while computer science majors could easily get an internship paying five times more than a lab assistant. So I became a computer science major, but I still wanted to do *something* that had chemistry. I still wanted to learn about chemistry.

So what did I do? I tried out everything *but* chemistry. I did courses in biology, microbiology and biochemistry. But none of them clicked. Every time my biology, microbiology or biochemistry professor mentioned something about chemistry in relation to a lecture topic I was so excited. But it would only be for a few minutes. I soon realised that the parts of courses I liked the most were the parts in which the professor made some connection to chemistry. 

After encouragement from my boyfriend, I did it. I registered into the organic chemistry course one day before the drop deadline. Whoever was managing the chemistry course requests and added me into CHEM 213 literally changed my life that day. Even though I failed quizzes, CHEM 213 was like a fresh of breath air for me. I was finally letting my 18 year old out; she could finally finish her chemistry.

Did I get that A+ in organic chemistry? Hell no. After a year of not doing any chemistry and taking the "biological sciences" route to the "chemistry" version of organic chemistry. (Essentially, UBC offers organic chemistry for chemistry majors, for biological sciences majors and biomedical engineering majors. I took the organic chemistry course for biological science majors and after getting a good, I was permitted to take the chemistry version of organic chemistry). But I care about that less, since I learned so much. In fact, I was able to get through a paper that a chemistry professor at UBC wrote. Last year I would have not been able to do that.


Changing majors isn't all rainbows and sunshine. Due to my advanced credit from IB, I could have finished my computer science degree in three years. Because I did co-op (and then dropped out from co-op), didn't plan my courses well, and switched my major, now I have to take five years. As of now, I think the extra year is worth it.

# molecules or money? academia or industry?

Something from my chemistry professor [Dr. Perrin](https://perrin.chem.ubc.ca/about-dr-perrin/) that I think a lot about:
> I opted to make molecules because if I ever gave that up, I could always make money whereas if I chose the money option, I would never have a chance to make a molecule.

# what's next

Currently, I'm read papers on operating systems, compilers, programming languages, chemistry and virology. I'm finally becoming okay with the things I like and worry less about doing what others are doing. I take courses that I want to and finally accepted that I want to learn about chemistry.
