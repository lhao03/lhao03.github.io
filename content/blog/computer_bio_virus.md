Taking [CPSC 213](@/school/cpsc213.md) and [MICB 306](@/school/micb306.md) together made me start wondering about the parallels between computer viruses and biological viruses. 

Firstly, a biological virus causes havoc by replicating it's genome, which means it tries to make our cells translate it's RNA (genome) over our RNA or alongside our RNA. RNA is a just a set of instructions telling the cell how to make proteins. This is very similar to computer viruses; computer viruses try to run their code either alongside the "good" code or also tries to block execution of the "good" code. Code is also a set of instructions telling the computer what to do. 

Secondly, a difference, is that I don't think computer viruses can evolve or mutate (?), probably because computers are not really prone to making mistakes and there isn't a need to change a working computer virus. Something like a [polymorphic virus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphic_code) seems like a mutating virus, but it's function doesn't change. On the other hand, translating RNA is more error prone then translating DNA, and virions are competing for resources and have to assemble properly before being released, so they are prone to the chemistry, physics and biology at that moment in time. So you could get a different virus strain upon releasing the new virons, though that new strain is not always more infectious. 

Another thing that's really interesting is how viruses can rearrange parts of your cell. HCV creates membranous webs, completely rearranging your ER to its liking. Kinda like corrupting the memory of your computer. 

It's quite interesting how a piece of code or piece of RNA could cause so much damage.
