*Extracted into it's own post. Is also part of this [post](@/blog/compsci/cs-edu.md), but I think this could also stand on it's own.*

> This is inspired by [Critically Conscious Computing](https://criticallyconsciouscomputing.org/), and I take quotes from that book.

There's many programs that are targeted towards minorities in computer science.  To me, most of them seem to almost be preying on this minority issue in computer science for their gain or don't seem to actually be helping. 

One I don't particularly like is KodeWithKlossy. Their programs seem highly inaccessible to those who really need it and have a lacking curriculum. Their programs focus on web development and iOS app development. iOS app development is already inaccessible; only MacBooks can run the required software (XCode) that is needed to develop an iOS app. If you don't have access to a laptop, you sure aren't buying a MacBook as your first. I never (and still don't) have had MacBook, so that program would simply be out of my reach. And if MacBooks were provided during the program, I wouldn't be able to use those skills outside of the program unless KodeWithKlossy gave everyone a MacBook, which they probably aren't. Additionally, after looking at the final projects created for the web development program, they are very simple and don't highlight key areas of computer science like problem-solving (through algorithms), abstraction, or operating systems, to just name a few. I'm sure if I took KodeWithKlossy, I would not want to go into computer science because building websites is not very interesting to me.

Another reason why these programs are highly inaccessible is due to cost. For instance, one three-week [KodeWithKlossy program](https://precollege.barnard.edu/kodewithklossy) cost 8795 USD. If the program ran for 3 weeks, 8 hours a day, this cost comes down to 52 USD per hour.

In comparison, the price breakdown for CPSC 110 at UBC: 
- 13 weeks of instruction
- 3 hours of lecture per week
- 3 hours of lab per week
- countless instructor and TA office hours (not counted in the calculation)

Would result in at least 78 hours, giving us 9 CAD per hour of lecture or lab. And this is not counting the many office hours students can get in addition to lectures and labs. And our [professor](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~gregor/) has been shaping this course for years.

It is simply appalling for anyone to pay this much for a program that isn't even a college or university course.

Another program I don't like is [SheCodes](https://www.shecodes.io/) which to me seems to prey on women trying to transition to a career in tech by teaching them web development (people specializing in web development is increasing quickly, and the field is becoming very inflated. Telling people that learning web development will get them a job or high salary may not be true in a few years. I also personally don't like web development). Oh, and it's not free.

This quote drives the point home that programs like KodeWithKlossy don't seem to really focus on helping those who are economically unable to seek out CS education, but those who have the money; *as long as there are women/gender minorities in our program (who can pay), who cares if they actually need help accessing CS programs or are the groups of people that need the most help*? The curriculum also seems very shallow, focussing on "hot" skills like web development and iOS development (I tried finding a more in depth curriculum but I couldn't). Is that bad? I think so, but others may think not. Focussing on gender minorities frames KodeWithKlossy as doing good (and not harm). This trend is also seen in SheCodes and other boot camps.

Another issue is that these programs (KodeWithKlossy and SheCodes) mainly/only teach "front-end" web development, which is quickly becoming a woman-dominated field. Is that good? I don't think so. Historically, when women enter certain fields, it "lowers" the value of that field. Front-end development is now seen as "easier" than backend. I'm a firm believer that women should not pick up front-end development as their "path" into tech. Sadly, KodeWithKlossy and SheCodes capitalizes on the "easiness" of [front-end development and shove it down women's throats](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/mar/14/tech-women-code-workshops-developer-jobs#:~:text=masculinity%20seizes%20prestige.-,Front%2Dend%20jobs%20are%20easier%20for%20women%20to%20obtain%2C%20and,women%20are%20front%2Dend%20developers.).

> The computing historian Marie Hicks can’t stand it when people tout coding camps as a solution to technology’s gender problem. “I think these initiatives are well-meaning, but they misunderstand the problem. The pipeline is not the problem; the meritocracy is the problem. The idea that we’ll just stuff people into the pipeline assumes a meritocracy that does not exist.”

If you do like web development, you can learn the same things KodeWithKlossy and SheCodes teaches (and way more) at [freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) FOR FREE. 

*KodeWithKlossy does have a free version too, but I still think the curriculum and topics are lacking (only focussing on front-end for web development) and exclusionary (iOS development). I don't know much about data science but it's nice to see that as an area to learn about.*

Now, there are programs that I do think are doing a great job at introducing minorities in computer science to what computer science actually is. [Jane Street](https://www.janestreet.com/join-jane-street/our-programs/) has programs ranging from a few days to a few weeks teaching concepts like OCaml, probability, arbitrage, and even some business concepts! 
From their [INSIGHT](https://www.janestreet.com/join-jane-street/our-programs/insight/) program:

> In the software engineering program, students will learn about OCaml and the libraries and tools that we use in our everyday work, as well as the fundamentals of building electronic trading systems. Then, they’ll put these tools to use by writing the back-end and UI for a computer game and a program that trades on a simulated stock exchange.

I really like their focus on using a functional programming language like OCaml, their mention of libraries (very important), tools (also very important), and also financial concepts (which I never got to learn and still haven't). These topics are not only super interesting, but involve topics in computer science like problem-solving, creating tested and robust programs (you would hope a trading system works correctly!), and involving the use of technology that can be installed on any operating system. The program also mentions learning about the back-end (which many boot camps/programs don't seem to dive into). Oh, and to my knowledge, this program is also free of cost. Below you can see the other types of programs they offer:

# Final thoughts
I think that computer science should be taught the same way as chemistry, biology, and physics for younger children. Learning physics doesn't mean you're a physicist, and that should become the norm with computer science. Also, when teaching a child science, you don't start throwing formulas and abstract concepts at them, you start with examples and talk about endeavours and discoveries done by humans in the field. 

Computer science should not just be taught as HTML and JavaScript, which is what many minority focussed CS programs are doing. We need to explore the rich history of computing! Just like how we learn about the [models of the atom](@/blog/other/do-good-explanations-have-to-be-true.md) and [different acid-base theories](@/blog/other/do-good-explanations-have-to-be-true.md) in chemistry in junior high and high school and then utilize models like the valence bond theory and hybridization in university, I think we should learn that computing begins from the invention of the abacus to human "computers" in WWII, and how we abstracted the human computer into the metal and inanimate computers we have today. 

Computer science can't keep being taught as just coding, and we should focus on other areas of computer science like operating systems, memory and data management, history and ethics and programming languages. Orgs focussing on young children should use [Critically Conscious Computing](https://criticallyconsciouscomputing.org/) as a basis for developing a curriculum. 

We can't forget that computer science is also math; it's basically applied math, so we should also teach computer science in a similar way that math is taught. This would be the job for universities. Once younger students learn more about the history of computer science, learning the math behind computer science like recursion, graphs, operating systems, compilers, and more will allow them to make connections in what they learned when they were younger. I think the university curriculum at UBC is pretty good, but I am not qualified at all to judge that. This would have been the path to computer science I wished to take. Essentially, teach computer science like science to younger children, and then teach computer science like math to older children.

 Boot camps should seek with university professors and industry folks to deliver a condensed but in depth curriculum over a longer span of time. You simply can't learn computer science or coding in 2 weeks, or even 2 months. [UBC's BCS](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/students/undergrad/degree-programs/bcs-program-second-degree) program is a great program for older folks looking to enter software development, as this 2 year program cuts out all the annoying breadth courses a regular university student would take, while making sure core courses like [Algorithm Design and Analysis](https://courses.students.ubc.ca/cs/courseschedule?pname=subjarea&tname=subj-course&dept=CPSC&course=320) and [Computer Hardware and Operating Systems](https://courses.students.ubc.ca/cs/courseschedule?pname=subjarea&tname=subj-course&dept=CPSC&course=313) are included. The program is also at a comparative or even cheaper price than most boot camps, and offer a much higher quality of education.

If boot camps want to be the cheaper and quicker alternative to university, or if orgs want to educate young people on computer science, they must commit to delivering a well rounded education in computer science, or they are simply exploiting people for their own gain.

*Updates: typos and added better photos. Changed to mainly/only teach front-end because there is now some focus on back-end but not really what back-end concepts. Added more to final thoughts.*
