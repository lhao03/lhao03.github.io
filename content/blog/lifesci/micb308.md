A Focus on Inhibiting Host Proteases and Targeting Conserved Residues of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro to Inhibit SARS-CoV-2 VOCs Infection 

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2, causes coronavirus 19, COVID-19. COVID-19 has two phases; the first phase involves virus transmission in the respiratory and gastrointestinal tract[^1], and the second phase involves collateral tissue damage and systemic failure[^1]. Thus, a broad spectrum therapeutic is needed to prevent the second phase of COVID-19.

An approach would be to use a multidrug regimen, which combines multiple therapeutics that target different parts of the viral life cycle. A multidrug regimen is advantageous over using a single drug because “drug-resistant mutants emerge soon after single-agent antiviral therapy”[^2].

I hypothesize a multidrug regimen consisting of two IAAS, N-0385, decanoyl-RVKR-chloromethylketone (CMK), as well as a DAA, Glecaprevir, will be a successful multidrug regimen for treatment of SARS-CoV-2 Delta infections. Since “targeting of host molecules minimizes the issue of drug resistance”[^2], N-0385 and CMK were chosen. Additionally, Glecaprevir binds to conserved residues in the main protease[^3].

The first drug is N-0385. N-0385 is an IAA, inhibiting TMPRSS2-like proteases with its ketobenzothiazole warhead which forms a covalent bond with the TMPRSS-2 catalytic triad Ser144, His296, Asp345[^4]. TMPRSS-2 is an important host factor that is used by SARS-CoV-2 to cleave and prime the S protein, facilitating viral entry and the fusion event[^4]. N-0385 also has low nanomolar potency, is broad-spectrum, and single daily intranasal use[^4], meaning less can be used to treat infection, and it can be easily administered. 
  
The second drug is CMK, an IAA which targets furin[^2]. Furin cleaves the S protein for fusogenicity and synthia formation, the latter causing systemic spread. CMK “suppresses cleavage of spikes and the syncytium”[^2]; immunoblot analysis showed a “dramatic decrease in the levels of processed S protein fragments in VeroE6 cells” which contained wild type S protein, and microscopic observation showed “significant inhibition of syncytium formation”[^2]. Treatment with CMK one hour before infection significantly decreased “virus titers of progeny viruses” after 24 and 48 hours[^2]. CMK is effective at a dosage of 5μM and has a 50% cytotoxic concentration of 318.2 μM[^2].

The third drug is Glecaprevir, which targets conserved residues in the binding pocket of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro[^3]. The “substrate-binding pocket of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro which is highly conserved among all the structures of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro”[^3], makes it an attractive target. Additionally, it plays an important role in replication and proteolytic processing. Glecaprevir binds in-between domain I and domain II in the substrate-binding pocket of Mpro with -9.6 affinity, forming three hydrogen bonds among Thr25, Cys145, Gln189, and two fluorine interactions with Thr26, Gly143[^3]. Thus, Glecaprevir hinders substrate accessibility, inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. 

There will need to be more research done to determine proper scheduling of use; how late after infection are the drugs still effective, and in what order or schedule results in maximal inhibition of infection. Additionally, we would need to manipulate the drugs into forms that are easily administered. N-0385 can be administered as a spray, but CMK and Glecaprevir administration were not discussed. TMPRSS-2 is not a cell essential gene[^5], so inhibiting it would probably cause “negligible side effects”[^5]. Similarly, since furin is a “ubiquitously expressed endoprotease”[^5], the same could be predicted, but more research needs to be done.
