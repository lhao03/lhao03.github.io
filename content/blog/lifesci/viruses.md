There's a lot of misconceptions about viruses floating around, and it's hard to dig through all that information. And with the arrival of COVID-19, it seems that everyone's become a virology expert, and yet they haven't. Many "solutions" around preventing or tracking COVID-19 ignore the chemistry, physics and biology of viruses, creating the idea that getting infected is like going into a ball pit and trying to avoid being hit by a "positive" ball. Technical solutions, like digital contract tracing apps reduces COVID-19 transmission into the idea that we only need to be near sick people to get sick.

Think about this. With surface spreading viruses or fluid (liquid) spreading viruses, we don't need to be near someone to get sick. People can get infected with cholera by using water from a stream that could by miles away from the infected person. We need to be in contact with that surface or fluid to get sick. It doesn't matter if that person is close or not, though that person being close can increase the risk of us getting sick, it's not the main determining factor. [In fact, there are several cases of COVID-19 transmission between people who have never seen each other, but have breathed the same air via air conditioning](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/7/20-0764_article).

As [Ali Alkhatib](https://ali-alkhatib.com/blog/digital-contact-tracing) says, 

> Digital contact tracing systems that render the world as normally distributed space with spheres of influence and contact characterized by radio waves will consistently leave us with dangerously wrong pictures of our exposure.

# To get infected, viruses require affinity and avidity with the human receptor.
There's a lot of chemistry, physics and biology involved in getting infected. First, the physics of viruses. Viruses spread through surface, liquid and air. The physics for each medium is different and it's important we all have some basic understanding of how to prevent transmission given the medium of spread. If transmission occurs by:

- surface: sanitize, wash your hands and don't shake hands.
- liquids: boil drinking water, don't drink suspicious liquids be vary of who you share fluids with.
- air: filter the air and wear a N95 mask when air filtration isn't possible or when you must interact with people.

But preventing transmission isn't always possible. To become infected, viruses require affinity and avidity. What does this mean? Well it's time for chemistry. Affinity is how strongly two molecules will react with each other. We can think of this as the binding even between the virus and human receptor. Next, we must have avidity, which is [the accumulated strength of multiple affinities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avidity). Once some threshold is met, you could become infected.

And the biology is how our body responds. Our immune systems will respond first, however infection can involve other organs, such as our lungs.

Okay, so what does this mean? There are some things we can't control, like how a virus spreads or which human receptor the virus will bind to and how strongly that virus will bind. But there are some things we can control, like avidity and our immune response. We can control our avidity to a virus by wearing high quality masks and requesting better air filtration. We can control our immune response by getting vaccines.

Contact tracing apps make it easy to forget the physics, chemistry and biology of viruses. These apps boil viruses down to exposure time and proximity to infected individuals. Many important factors like the method of spread, avidity and immune response are forgotten with these software solutions.

# Viruses mutate at random. A lot.
But viruses don't mutate everywhere at random. We've observed with COVID-19 variants and other coronaviruses that there are some conserved regions that undergo mutation a lot less. For instance, the [residues of the substrate-binding pocket of the substrate-binding pocket are highly conserved](https://portlandpress.com/bioscirep/article/40/6/BSR20201256/224927/Glecaprevir-and-Maraviroc-are-high-affinity) and don't really undergo much mutation, since this protein is essential to replication and proteolytic processing.

But the spike protein on the other hand goes through a lot of mutation. For instance, [many Omicron's mutations](https://covariants.org/variants/21K.Omicron) are associated with the ACE2 receptor binding and antibody binding sites (our vaccines currently target these proteins). 

Mutations are random, but those random mutations that can survive current drugs and vaccines are the viruses that will continue to spread. Mutations that occur on proteins like the main protease may also occur, but some mutations are more deadly to the virus than others, and these mutated viruses simply cease to replicate, ending their ability to spread.

With that being said, for current drugs and vaccines to continue working, we have to slow down the chance for the virus mutate. The likelihood of mutation increases as more and more people become infected. This means we must prevent infection. 

People will argue that infection is mild, but getting infected isn't just about getting infected. It's about whether or not you become the new reservoir to the next COVID-19 variant.

How a digital contact tracing app could help prevent new variants could be by preventing infection. Preventing infection means letting people know if they have been sick, and gathering information on infected people. Unfortunately, in Western nations, it seems that government has given up on this. 

## Lack of maintainability and unclear goal of the digital contact tracing app. 
The Canadian government came out with a report, [Interim report on social and economic determinants of app adoption, retention and use](https://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/icgc.nsf/eng/07716.html), but I'll read that later and then write about it. The thread below gives a nice overview of the report.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">part of “responsible innovation/experimentation” and trust is how you end the thing. this idea was 1. bad on policy at the front, 2. lauded/paraded for technical execution (not efficacy) by the govt + others 3. now it just sits there.</p>&mdash; Bianca Wylie (@biancawylie) <a href="https://twitter.com/biancawylie/status/1515093743149404168?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 15, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

With more variants emerging, the government has a responsibility to update it's citizens about these variants and provide data to help citizens make informed decisions.

And as with any software, software must be maintained. Our world is constantly changing, and software must adapt to these changes, not the other way around. However, it seems today that the world is constantly catering to the software.

# We don't get suck from being near someone, but from interacting with the virus by surface, liquid or air. Viruses may be more airborne than we thought
In virology lecture we are taught that airborne particles can be respiratory droplets or aerosolised particles. At the beginning of the pandemic, WHO made the erroneous judgement that COVID-19 was spread through respiratory droplets that eventually fall onto surfaces and then infect those that touch those surfaces. This horrible mistake led Western nations to [slap a sanitizer machine at every building entrance, increase their sanitization of desks and more surface focused cleaning](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00251-4).

[But can you blame WHO for this faulty judgement](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-00925-7)? [Well, it depends, because lot's of medical experts were making the assumption that most viruses couldn't be airborne since they were smaller than 5 microns.](https://www.wired.com/story/the-teeny-tiny-scientific-screwup-that-helped-covid-kill/). But that number was actually cherry picked out of context.

[Many Asian countries have ignored WHO](https://twitter.com/JayCityExplore/status/1476868848393535498), acting on research that is paints COVID-19 as a much more infectious virus than WHO and Western nations think. And it seems to have paid off. On the other hand, Western nations have followed much of WHO's advice. 

But there's a [history](https://www.wired.com/story/the-teeny-tiny-scientific-screwup-that-helped-covid-kill/) to the mistake WHO made. 

> In 1934, Wells and his wife, Mildred Weeks Wells, a physician, analyzed air samples and plotted a curve showing how the opposing forces of gravity and evaporation acted on respiratory particles. The couple’s calculations made it possible to predict the time it would take a particle of a given size to travel from someone’s mouth to the ground. According to them, particles bigger than 100 microns sank within seconds. Smaller particles stayed in the air. Randall paused at the curve they’d drawn. To her, it seemed to foreshadow the idea of a droplet-aerosol dichotomy, but one that should have pivoted around 100 microns, not 5. 

So what happened? Why haven't we been using the 100 micron metric? Well, 

> Part of medical rhetoric is understanding why certain ideas take hold and others don’t. So as spring turned to summer, Randall started to investigate how Wells’ contemporaries perceived him. That’s how she found the writings of Alexander Langmuir, the influential chief epidemiologist of the newly established CDC. Like his peers, Langmuir had been brought up in the Gospel of Personal Cleanliness, an obsession that made handwashing the bedrock of US public health policy. He seemed to view Wells’ ideas about airborne transmission as retrograde, seeing in them a slide back toward an ancient, irrational terror of bad air—the “miasma theory” that had prevailed for centuries. Langmuir dismissed them as little more than “interesting theoretical points.”

And then after Langmuir disparaged Well's work he came up with this:

> In the report, Langmuir cited a few studies from the 1940s looking at the health hazards of working in mines and factories, which showed the mucus of the nose and throat to be exceptionally good at filtering out particles bigger than 5 microns. The smaller ones, however, could slip deep into the lungs and cause irreversible damage. If someone wanted to turn a rare and nasty pathogen into a potent agent of mass infection, Langmuir wrote, the thing to do would be to formulate it into a liquid that could be aerosolized into particles smaller than 5 microns, small enough to bypass the body’s main defenses. Curious indeed. Randall made a note.

Langmuir did eventually shift his tone and accept that airborne infection was possible. After Well's died, Langmuir delivered a speech stating "problematic particles—the ones they had to worry about—were smaller than 5 microns." [And that screwup started it all](https://www.wired.com/story/the-teeny-tiny-scientific-screwup-that-helped-covid-kill/). However, particles that are 100 microns are airborne!

While most viruses are 0.1 to 0.5 microns, viruses hitch a ride on the droplets that we produce when breathing, sneezing or coughing. From this [study](https://www.materials-talks.com/droplet-sizing-of-coughs-and-sneezes/) there are droplets that measure at below or around 100 microns.

Okay, that was a lot of preamble. I wanted to set up why the virus being airborne is important and how digital contact tracing misses on this. Digital contact tracing apps seems like a fun algorithmic problem to determine who's been near who! Which is just another complex public health and social problem reduced into a algorithm. It seems perfect. In fact, I was exited for Canada to get their own contact tracing app after seeing some success in countries like South Korea and Taiwan. 

But the app is missing a lot of context. For one, depending on whether or no the air is actively being filtered, being 6 ft (or 2m) may be enough distance, or it might not be. The app simply doesn't know, and giving erroneous information is worse than no information. The app doesn't know anything about the quality of the air. Distance doesn't matter so much if the air is being constantly filtered. A CO2 monitor would be more helpful than an app that tells me if I've been near a sick person.

Additionally, education on proper masks has been non existent, with some health leaders suggesting that cloth masks are still okay to wear ([they aren't](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/10/commentary-what-can-masks-do-part-1-science-behind-covid-19-protection)). I've gotten most of my mask information from medical experts on Twitter. The app doesn't talk about masks at all (last time I checked). 

{{ blogImg(img="mask.jpg") }}

Essentially, the app gives the totally wrong idea that getting sick means being near someone sick. You get sick from inhaling air that has particles with the virus, and once you've hit a certain threshold, then you can become infected. All the money going into building digital contact tracing apps could of one into providing high quality masks, CO2 monitors and better air filtration systems. [Alberta spent $4.3 million on their digital contact tracing app, which only notified 1,500 people of possible exposure.](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/158-albertans-with-covid-19-reported-their-illness-to-province-s-multimillion-dollar-app-1.6202636). 

# What must be done? 
I like the points [Ali Alkhatib](https://ali-alkhatib.com/blog/digital-contact-tracing) gave and highly recommend you read his blog post on digital contact tracing.
