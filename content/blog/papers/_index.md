Below you can read my sporadic and simple thoughts on papers and books by great people!

## Ranking Papers
I'm currently reading a bunch of papers and books to see what I'm interested in and I wanted a way to rank each paper. I'm going to use two criteria, understanding and interest. 

{{ expand(title="Interest",
content="
1. I'm falling asleep.
2. Reading through the paper is a like a task and I'd rather read another paper.
3. 
4. 
5. The paper is neutral. I don't mind reading it, but I don't think I'd miss reading it.
6. Has some interesting points.
7. 
8. 
9. 
10. I feel excited reading this and would love researching more about this topic."
) }}

{{ expand(title="Understanding",
content="
1. I don't understand a single sentence.
2. I know less than half of the key words and have a very limited (non existent) understanding of the paper.
3. I know most key words but I can't really understand the main idea of the paper.
4. I know most words and understand the idea but get lost still.
5. I know most key words and have a general idea of the topic of the paper but couldn't explain much about the paper to anyone.
6. I can get a good idea about the topic of the paper, but can't really form any questions or my own thoughts on the paper and I have trouble talking about the paper to someone else and have to refer back. 
7. I can understand the paper and overarching ideas and details well, and have some of my own thoughts on the paper, but those thoughts may be half baked. I can get a general idea of the paper across to someone without needing to refer back the paper.
8. I've come across the same problem/topic in the paper, and understand the ideas and solutions presented, and could talk about them with someone else.
9. I've also thought about the same ideas and come across the same research problem. I can lightly debate about the paper with someone else and can think of questions to ask the authors.
10. I could of written this myself (well not really)! I could probably present the paper to someone else clearly and have a conversation with the authors."
) }}

Currently, my understanding of topics is (most understanding to least) virology, biochemistry/chemical biology, computer science, chemistry.

As for my interests ranking of topics, I'm not sure yet.
