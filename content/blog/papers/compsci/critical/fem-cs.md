> “I had a sense of not being quite integrated, my self was missing because I could not identify with [them]… [I was] a different sort of being, not quite of the same species. [I saw this] as a lack in myself” (Lugones 1990 p. 393).

> The experiences I had are shared by many others (e.g. female students) who do not feel at home in the discipline, and, just as Maria Lugones writes, might see this as a lack in themselves. These experiences and feelings of ‘outsiderness’ are driving forces for making the discipline more inclusive, so that different ways of ‘being’ are accepted. [p20]

> When I started my research, my thinking was (implicitly) dominated by the idea of defining a problem and then finding a way to resolve it. This is fundamentally and deeply rooted within the engineer, although it is seldom articulated and made visible. I was trained to delimit a problem, make it as simple as possible, and then apply the most straightforward solution. This is an approach where logical and abstract thinking are emphasised. Within CS, I was further trained in the use of algorithmic approaches to problem solving. This tends to encourage linear thinking about problems. Thus, my education and professional life had trained me in a certain way of thinking and approaching problems.  [21]

> My argument for focusing on this ‘paradigmatic basis’ of computer science was that issues concerning CS itself and its knowledge processes were for the most part absent in research and discussions on gender and CS. [21]

> The process of blackboxing is equivalent to the process of naturalisation, in which something (an artefact, an idea, a concept, etc.) is stripped of its origins, context and consequences and is regarded as given, as self-evident. [22]

- knowledge is intertwined with communication and language.

> “The field of computer science education research has a cross-disciplinary structure, and encompasses computer science – of course – but also a wide range of other disciplines: pedagogy, psychology, cognitive science, learning technology, sociology to mention a few. What unifies this diversified field is the aim to improve learning and teaching within computer science, and thereby to contribute to computer science.” (Ibid p. 23). 

> Since technology is seen as neutral, this stance has not seldom
led to seeing women as the problem: women should be informed / educated / adapted
to technology: “Women shall be enticed into existing practice and adapt to it.” (Trojer
1999, p. 13). With this view, it is mainly women who are expected to change. [26]

> Th ere
is also a tendency within liberal feminism to treat men and women as homogeneous
groups, ignoring diff erences between individuals, as well as for example ethnicity and
class. In practice, liberal feminist projects have had very little impact on the gender
balance within technology or computer science; in fact this approach can be seen as
reproducing and reinforcing the status quo. [26]
