I like computer science, but not the tech industry. The elegance and beauty of computer science has been diminished to slow, inefficient JavaScript programs full of bugs and security vulnerabilities with flashy marketing, and these embarrassing programs are praised by managers, venture capitalists, and PMs who don't care about computer science at all. 

This seems to happen to alot of areas. [In the vegan food industry, an area booming with vegan foodies has now been overtaken by white male venture capitalists hoping to bank big on the next food revolution](https://www.michelersimon.com/articles/the-natural-foods-industry-is-not-safe-for-women).
