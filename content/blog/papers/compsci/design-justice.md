# Introduction:
{{ quote(text="Before seeking new design solutions, we look for what is already working at
the community level. We honor and uplift traditional, indigenous, and local
knowledge and practices.",

- designing is fundamental to being human
- we design our world, while our world acts back on us and designs us
- everyone designs, but only some kinds of design is acknowledged, valorized, remunerated, credited
- speculative: envisioning, manipulating the future
- design thinking deployed to reproduce colonial political economy

## Intersectionality
- Black Women:
  - could not represent all women
  - could not represent all Black people
  - viewed discrimination as only "single-identity"
  - since not enough Black women, could not statistically show discrimination claims
- single-axis analysis: race, class, gender as independent construct
- most design principles and practices => single-axis framework
- design justice analysis: not to make systems more inclusive, but to refuse to design them at all

## Matrix of Domination
- race, class, gender as interlocking systems of oppression
- benefits and harms based on location within matrix of domination
- situated knowledge over universalit knowledge
  - no group has clear angle of vision, possesses theory or methodology that allows it to discover the absolute truth or declare its theories and methodologies as universal norm
