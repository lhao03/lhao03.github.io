# Introduction:
{{ quote(text="Before seeking new design solutions, we look for what is already working at
the community level. We honor and uplift traditional, indigenous, and local
knowledge and practices.",

- designing is fundamental to being human
- we design our world, while our world acts back on us and designs us
- everyone designs, but only some kinds of design is acknowledged, valorized, remunerated, credited
- speculative: envisioning, manipulating the future
- design thinking deployed to reproduce colonial political economy

## Intersectionality
- Black Women:
  - could not represent all women
  - could not represent all Black people
  - viewed discrimination as only "single-identity"
  - since not enough Black women, could not statistically show discrimination claims
- single-axis analysis: race, class, gender as independent construct
- most design principles and practices => single-axis framework
- design justice analysis: not to make systems more inclusive, but to refuse to design them at all

## Matrix of Domination
- race, class, gender as interlocking systems of oppression
- benefits and harms based on location within matrix of domination
- situated knowledge over universalit knowledge
  - no group has clear angle of vision, possesses theory or methodology that allows it to discover the absolute truth or declare its theories and methodologies as universal norm

# 1 Design values: Hard-Coding Liberation

gies that reproduce existing systems of power inequality when it is so
clear to so many that we urgently need to dismantle those systems?",

- affordances: object's properties that show the possible actions user's can take with it => how they may interact with the object
- capitalism has shaped the design of objects
- is given affordance equally available to all people?
- disaffordances: match perceptual cues with actions that will be blocked or constrained
  - dysaffordances: user must misidentify to access object's functions
- design justice is not about intentionality, it's about process and outcomes
- discriminatory design: spirometer had "race correction" button because it was thought race determined lung capacity
  - Black workers had to show more severe clinical outcomes than white workers
- healthcare as male-focussed: artificial heart it 86% of men but only 20% of women

{{ quote(text="Instead, we might say that design constantly instanti-
ates power inequality via technological affordances, across domains,
in ways both big and small.",

- value-sensitive design:
- universal design:
- inclusive design:
