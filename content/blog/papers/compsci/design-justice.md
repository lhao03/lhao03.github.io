- designing is fundamental to being human
- we design our world, while our world acts back on us and designs us
- everyone designs, but only some kinds of design is acknowledged, valorized, remunerated, credited
- speculative: envisioning, manipulating the future
- design thinking deployed to reproduce colonial political economy
