# 12 Coding is not empowerment
- Code.org: blames on the "education pipeline" 
- Paul Graham: change middle school computer science curriculum
- implicit bias training programs: no research demonstrating their effectiveness 
  - sometimes made matters worse
- pipeline argument: puts it on underrepresented groups to solve their own exclusion by learning to code at a early age.
- Hadi Partovi: belief machines are objective and socially neutral
- Jacob Kaplan-Moss: "Programmers like to think they work in a field that is logical and analytical, but the truth is that there is no way to even talk about programming ability in a systematic way. When humans don’t have any data, they make up stories, but those stories are simplistic and stereotyped."
- harmful to believe tech industry is meritocratic

than a moral failing within the industry, then diversity initiatives can only be justi-

- Ellen Berrry: celebration of cultural differences as competitive advantage, diversity as end goal with instructional pay-offs
- programs teaching coding: business case rather than fairness issue
- explicit meritocratic: managerial positions favor male employee over equally qualified female employee

- macho heroics
- encourage minorities to solve problems in their own communities; affluent white men don't understand the problem and context and make products full of blindspots
