> To that end we therefore ask, what must a functioning member of our society know about computing?

Humans have always tried to consolidate information, at first it was with books that were static and hard to add new information to, and now it's Wikipedia and Google. Because there was less information to document back then, it was easier to know what information was useful. Now there's a lot of information, but information has it's time and place and it's hard to know what information to learn or understand at a period in time. Which raises the question in this article: "To that end we therefore ask, what must a functioning member of our society know about computing?"

Charles Babbage was a product of church but a scientist, and had the view that information could be mechanized. Babbage wished that "calculations had been executed by steam" because he was working on stuff and had errors in the calculations which were done by hand.

Ada Lovelace expressed this new way of thinking: “We may say most aptly that the Analytic Engine weaves algebraic patterns just as the Jacquard loom weaves flowers and leaves.”

Grady Booch says that "productive members of society must grasp the essence of the human-made cosmos around them." But whether or not that means to learn how to code, Grady mentions we should learn computational thinking: 

But we must "be careful to not teach coding as just a vocational skill". A vocational skill is "practical or firsthand skills that help a person master a trade or a job".

I express the same view [here](@/blog/compsci/cs-edu.md).

> "Rather, I think it’s essential that we fundamentally teach the notion of computational thinking, a point of view first proposed by Jeannette Wing. As she defines it, “Computational thinking involves solving problems, designing systems, and understanding human behavior by drawing on the concepts fundamental to computer science. Computational thinking includes a range of mental tools that reflect the breadth of the field of computer science”"

Grady also mentions that Wing's ideas parallel with Carl Sagan's, who observed "science is much more than a body of knowledge. It is a way of thinking"
