- fixed mindset: helpless response to substantial challenges
  - seek performance goals: mainly want to demonstrate ability
  - view error message as challenge to their intelligence
  - less likely to value collaborative learning

- growth mindset: welcome challenges, display mastery-orientated response, maintain self-esteem
  - attribute failure to lack of effort rather than lack of intellectual ability
  - seek learning goals without fears of making mistakes
  - view error messages as opportunities to learn

- self-efficacy: individual's judgement of their ability to perform task within domain
  - positively correlated to performance

# moving towards malleability
- learning most effective when tasks are slightly too difficult for students to do on their own but the task can be done with scaffolding, or targeted help and guidance => zone of proximal development
