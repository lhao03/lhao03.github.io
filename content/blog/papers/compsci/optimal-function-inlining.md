- inlining functions enables other optimizations because you can now see the function body
- however choosing which functions to inline are nontrivial because inlining a function can affect the rest of the compiler pipeline
- outperforms state-of-the-art LLVM by 7% on average

# 1 introduction
- inlining can enable to dead code elimination or lead to code size bloat
- inlining is as hard as knapsack NP-complete problem; so there's many heuristics
  - heuristic: trial and error method 
- no systematic study to investigate optimal inlining
- focus on reducing binary size: deterministic and does not depend on workload selection, while performance does
- straightforward search space is 2^n, where *n* is the number of inlinable call sites
- local independence property => autotuning strategy

contributions made
- novel formulation of the search space
- first extensive systematic study of optimal inlining 
- simple, effective inlining autotuning strategy

# 2 background
- notation: {{ katex(body="\{(A \rarr B) : inline, (B \rarr C) : no-inline\}") }}
- inlining may introduce multiple copies of the same call

# 3 formulate the inlining search space
- given a call graph *G* with {{ katex(body="|E_G|") }} edges, {{ katex(body="2^{|E_G|}") }} configurations exist, and all of them must be evaluated to to find the optimal 
- independent components can be independently explored
  - considering the connected components of a graph, *cc*, the search space becomes {{ katex(body="\sum_{c \in cc} {2^{|E_G|}}") }}
- connected components: are independent w.r.t inlining
- not inlining a bridge is identical to deleting it w.r.t inlining: additional independent components are created
  - bridge: edge that when removed will increase the # of connected components
  - each inlined call can potentially extend the scope of compiler transformations
  - inlining callgraph *B* that connects two call graph components is the only way to combine their optimization scopes 
    - if *B* is not inlined the components can be independently searched
- partitioning the search space can potentially lead to a smaller search space
- new bridges are created as callgrpah is dynamically updated by removing non-inlined edges or merged nodes across inlined ones => used to reduce the search space
- can be visualized through an inlining tree (it's recursive!)
  - outgoing edges are labeled inline or no-inline
  - each path from root to leaf is inlining configuration
  - the search space is the number of `InliningTreeLeafs` plus the number of `InliningTreeComponentNodes` in the tree
    - each leaf corresponds to a partial inline configuration and each set of independent inlining components require an extra evaluation to combine the best child configurations
- partition edge selection: prioritize bridges so many independent components arise

# 5 local inlining autotuner for size
- a large percentage of edges is not inlined
- shorter inlined call chains are more prevalent
- all optimally inlined call chains contain only one edge, so they are either in different connected call graph components or no inlined edges connect them
