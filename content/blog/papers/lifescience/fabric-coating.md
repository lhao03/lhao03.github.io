- passive contact inactivation through amine/imine functionalities
- active photodynamic inactivation through reactive oxygen species

- no inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 samples treated in the dark, so passive surface effect is not effective against SARS-CoV-2.
- ~20, ~80%, and complete reduction in SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid in light conditions.

**Effect of ROS on enveloped virus particles**
- likely impede viral entry and fusion through modification of viral membrane liquid and glycoprotein components.
