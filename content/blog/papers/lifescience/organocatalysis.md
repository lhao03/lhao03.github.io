- reactions with considerable synthetic effort with uncertain results are not likely to be explored.
- [organocatalyst](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/chemistry/organocatalyst): mimic enzyme catalysis that Mother Nature uses to control and regulate both biologically important reactions and synthesis of secondary metabolites.
  - enantioselective: use of chiral coordination complexes as catalysts
- use Statistical models to distinguish between different catalysts and reactions to guide selection of synthetic routes.

- reactions optimized on simple substrates often fail on similar, but more complex systems due to differences in reaction requirements.
  - there are limited amounts of high-value substrates
  - use of multivariate linear regression as a tool to change in any reaction component will alter the experimental outcome.

prediction tasks (taken directly from the paper)
- Despite the diverse structural features embedded in target molecules, is it possible to predict the enantioselectivity of key steps toward their synthesis?
- If so, can this be applied toward both complex scaffolds and single-molecule targets?
-  Finally, when different catalysts and reactions can be utilized to generate the same products, can statistical models allow the selection of the best synthetic route?
