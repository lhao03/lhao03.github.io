My eating disorder began to take over my life when I was 13. It started out as starving myself, and at the same time I became a competitive cross country runner. I know, quite the combo. It didn't just stop there; I tried the paleo diet, vegan diet and then macro counting. 

I wanted to be as skinny as possible, and everyday I thought I was fat. In fact, I was not; I weighed less than my brother, who was 6 years younger than me.

My eating disorder never goes away. There are just some days, even month's, where I forget I have one. But there's always some part of it lingering in your mind, ready to take control of your food decisions. Sometimes it presents itself as suddenly unwilling to eat out because of the calories; you just had pasta yesterday. Or it's when you decide to skip lunch for a week. The same with body dysmorphia. When I decide one day I'm too fat and my stomach sticks out, I can't do anything without feeling unworthy and shameful. 

It sucks. But it does get better.
