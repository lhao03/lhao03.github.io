# I can't cook
After moving away to university, I seldom ate any traditional Chinese food. I rarely eat out, so I cooked most of my food. Due to my eating disorder, I control over all my meals when I was around 13 or 14. I would refuse to eat my parent's cooking or only small amounts. When I become 16 I rarely, if ever, ate any traditional Chinese food. I went through every dietary lifestyle you would think of:

- keto
- vegan and sometimes raw vegan (oh god)
- low carb
- IIFYM (If it fits your macros)
- fasting

I would make up any excuse to say why I couldn't eat my mother's meals:
- too many carbs (noodles, rice) so it wouldn't fit my keto diet.
- used animal products, so wasn't vegan.
- too many carbs, so not low carb
- since I couldn't accurately count the calories, I couldn't fit it into my macros
- fasting meant I ate at weird times like 3pm or 8pm, so the food my mom cooked was cold or all eaten by my family.

Because of my strict diet, foods I allowed myself to eat were not many and were very plain. Any extra flavoring like salt would make me bloated, and extra oils were useless calories I could eat in different forms. My diet consisted of plain egg whites, boiled vegetables, boiled meats, and raw fruit. When I was vegan, this obviously excluded the animal products, and I sometimes ate homemade high protein bread. When I was keto, I'd also eat plain greek yogurt and cottage cheese.

As a result, I was never interested in cooking and excused myself from family meal gatherings. Food just became a means of fuel and nutrients; I didn't see it as a way for people to come together and a way culture was preserved. 

My eating disorder ruined relationships and caused me to stray away from others. It was awkward to have others watch and question why I was eating this or that, so I simply didn't eat in front of people.

Now, I live somewhere with a stove, and I can't even cook the simplest of Chinese dishes. I don't understand how different spices mingle, what types of meats work with what spices, how to make dumpling filling, or my favorite pork bone soup. My family's Chinese recipes may just end with me, because of my eating disorder. And it sucks.
