So what have I been up to these past four months? <!-- more --> A few things include:
- starting my first internship
- helping organize StarHacks
- TAing for the first time
- turning 20 (and still can't drive)
- doing the most nerve-wracking interview of my life
- discovered that I like IU's songs
- finishing up my one course (that I did well in!)
 
But that‚Äôs just the tip of the iceberg.
 

## üåü StarHacks
When I received an email saying that I was chosen to join the StarHacks team in September 2020 I was so excited. Until I saw what team I was on: outreach. Before we go any further, I‚Äôll explain why I felt that way:
 
In high school, I took English IB. But I was *horrible* at English; after hours of tutoring, crying, and revising, the highest mark I could muster on an essay was 75%. By some stroke of luck, I scored a 6 on my English IB exams. However, after dealing with years of getting low marks from essays, it was ingrained into me that I was just bad at writing. Maybe I was only good at objective things like science and math. And I became okay with that. 
 
So when I saw that bolded ‚ÄúOutreach‚Äù in the email, I was scared. Outreach is all about explaining your ideas to someone to convince them that you're worth listening to. Writing is the same thing. How could someone like me be any good at outreach? For some unknown reason, I accepted the team invitation. 
 
As the months went by, I realized that outreach wasn‚Äôt so bad. There is one thing I didn‚Äôt mention about the essays I wrote in English class. The essays that I got 75% on; well those were critical analytical essays in which we had to write about a novel or poem. When we got to write a personal essay about our life experiences, I scored 90% on those. And that‚Äôs what outreach soon began to feel like; writing a personal essay. 
 
You see, StarHacks‚Äô mission is to create a community for women and non-binary individuals in computer science. While I didn‚Äôt know it at the time, I'm the same as all the girls who attended StarHacks; the girl who was scared of C++ and felt like dropping from the CS major in the first year (you can read about that [here](/blog/cs-bchem)). By writing newsletters, creating infographics, and talking with these girls and non-binary individuals, I could encourage them to try out CS. And that to me, is the entire reason why I decided to join the StarHacks team. Since being a woman in STEM is a large part of my identity, outreach no longer was something I dreaded doing. I‚Äôm excited to be joining nwPlus as a marketing coordinator and I'm looking forward to the impact that I can make!

 
## üë©üèª‚Äçüíª Career
The weeks leading up to my first co-op had me in a ball of nerves. Imposter syndrome struck hard and I couldn't stop thinking of thoughts like "What if they regret hiring me?" or "What if I can't do anything?". Fortunately, as I settled into my internship, I quickly forgot I had those thoughts in the first place! From learning all about biomedical text extraction, to even learning a bit about breast cancer, I've had a wonderful time at the PROOF Centre. You can read about that [here](/blog/my-first-internship/).

My thoughts on hackathons have changed, and you can read more [here](/blog/hackathons/).

Less than one month into my internship, I got an email for a first-round interview from a company. I nearly fell out of my chair and I ran to my father to show him the email. I was in disbelief, and after my shock wore off, I started to feel scared. This interview was for a software engineer position, so I knew there was going to be some leetcode style questions. And at the time I probably did less than 10 leetcode questions, so I got down to practicing my data structures and algorithms. Amazingly, I passed the first round of interviews and was invited for a final round of interviews! The final round of interviews included three 45 minute interviews with three different members of the company. I remember how exhausted I was when I finished my last interview and I just ended up staring at my laptop for the rest of the day. And to my shock, I received an email telling me that I had passed the final round of interviews! 
 
I have to thank my boyfriend, [Ryan](https://github.com/rmehri01), and my friend [Jacky](https://github.com/jackyzha0), both of which helped me so much with preparation. Ryan would video call me for hours every day to practice everything from my leetcoding to my behavioral questions. Jacky also freed up time in his very busy schedule to do some mock interviews with me. I can‚Äôt thank them enough! In the next few weeks, you‚Äôll see what this company is (I‚Äôm still in shock about getting an offer).
 
 
## üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Health and Fitness 
Unfortunately, not all was good. With an increasing workload, and my decision to work two jobs, I became much less active. I also started skipping meals and working out on an empty stomach. Due to my eating disorder, I've developed digestive issues, so skipping meals caused me a lot of stomach pain. 

It's also been a year since I lifted anything heavier than 50 lbs. And I'm going insane. The gym has always been a place for me to zone out, but being at home makes that a lot harder. With a lack of equipment, working out just didn't seem fun anymore. Since I could just run upstairs if I got an email from work, working out was no longer me time, but something I did to make sure I got in my daily exercise.

After realizing how unfit I had gotten, I did the unthinkable; I started to run again. I quit the cross country in high school and never looked back, so running was something that I didn't think I'd ever do again; at least not every day. For the past month, I've been running anywhere from 20 to 40 mins a day, along with some calisthenics. And I feel better. Running is no substitute for weight lifting, but running allows me to zone out and ignore the world for a while.

A typical Monday to Friday.

While physical health and nutrition are super important to me, my eye health and brain health are easily left on the back burner. I've had days where my eyes are so sore I have to pause every few minutes to just close them. Being nearsighted doesn't make my horrible eye health any better. I hope to start implementing some healthy eye habits because I do take my eyes for granted.

## ü§î Life
Despite being 20, I still feel like an 18-year-old who just finished high school. I still can't drive, have never tried alcohol, and live at home (though I don't mind this one too much). Some of that can be attributed to the pandemic. While the pandemic sucks, I've gotten into the habit of having friendly debates with my dad, running terminal commands on my brother's laptop to look cool üòé, and more chats with my mom. And I'm very grateful for that.
