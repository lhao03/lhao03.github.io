## Berkeley
  - [Chemistry](https://chemistry.berkeley.edu/chem-research)
    - no GRE due to COVID
  - [Chemical Engineering](https://chemistry.berkeley.edu/cbe-research)
    - no GRE
  - [Chemical Biology](https://chembio.berkeley.edu/)
    - get into Chemistry PhD first

Application Details
- superior performance and research experience in past two years of undergrad studies
- statement of purpose
- personal history statement
  - The personal statement should give concrete evidence of your promise as a member of the academic community, giving the committee an image of you as a person.
  - This is also where you represent your potential to bring to your academic career a critical perspective rooted in a non-traditional educational background, or your understanding of the experiences of groups historically under-represented in higher education and your commitment to increase participation by a diverse population in higher education.

  - how enzymes function as such formidable catalysts
  - The role of non-covalent interactions between the enzyme and substrate in stabilisation of ground and transition states has held a particular fascination for me, as well as the development of methodologies to stabilise or trap intermediates in catalysis. Increasingly I am becoming interested in applying our understanding to the development of new tools and hopefully therapeutics.
