No, not everyone should learn how to code - instead, we need to learn about computing and computers.

I recently wrote a [rant-like post](/blog/cs-edu/) about my thoughts on my path to CS. Since then, I’ve been thinking of what computer science/computing education should look like. The first instance of computer science education I came across was in the form of “Everyone should learn how to code”. The more I think about this tech marketing mantra that has been screamed at me from every boot camp, online MOOC, and even President Obama, the more and more I disagree with it; instead we should all learn about computers and computing (no, not how to use Microsoft Word or Excel). 

# Does that mean Lucy doesn’t like coding?
This article isn’t saying that we should not teach coding. Coding (or programming) is a mechanism to make a concept (in computer science) tangible. I’ll use a metaphor using concepts in chemistry. In organic chemistry, you study many reaction mechanisms, understanding the electronics, stereochemistry, and energy behind why this reaction will produce the product that you want. But being able to predict which product you will produce is different from actually performing that chemical reaction in the lab. In the lab, you need skills like pipetting, visual cues, knowledge of proper reactant ratios, how to preserve the product (you can’t just leave it in the reactant solution!), and more. Without these lab skills, it doesn't matter how good you are at organic chemistry, because you can’t even make the damn molecule. 

I liken this to coding. In the classroom, you might learn about tree traversal algorithms, the concept of allocating and freeing your memory, and how to prove your algorithm is correct and will produce the desired output, much like coming up with a reaction mechanism that produces the drug you want. But coding this algorithm requires you to understand (given whatever programming language you use), how to get that programming language running in the first place, the syntax rules (semicolons or parens?), how to spot and fix memory leaks, how to spot dangling pointers and more. Watching a video on pipetting doesn’t make you an expert at pipetting, just like how watching someone correctly implement an algorithm in C or Python doesn’t make you an expert coder. 

So I am most definitely a proponent of coding. But this doesn’t mean coding is something everyone needs to learn, just like everyone doesn’t need to learn how to pipette. If you want to work in a chemistry lab, you will need lab skills. Similarly, if you want to become a software engineer, you'll need to code. But everyone is not going be producing drugs or programming applications. Maybe you argue that coding will become a part of everyone's jobs, but I don’t think this will happen. Computers will become a part of everyone's jobs, but people don't need to know or understand C to use a computer. This is because software engineers will abstract the coding away into nice and easy-to-use user interfaces. Take Apple’s Shortcuts; you have to drag phrases and construct something like “if X does Y, make Z display A”.  Learning about computing (like logic) would allow someone to make their shortcut. You don’t need to learn how to code to use Shortcuts. 

# Why "Learn to code?"
But before I get into why everyone should learn about computing and computers, I wanted to explore deeper into this “Learn to Code” movement. 

## How Learn to Code got me into computer science
I have loved chemistry since I was 13 (hence the chemistry metaphors). I never cared about getting a high-paying job until I was applying for universities and realized you couldn’t get paid much for having a Bachelor's degree in chemistry. The “Learn to Code” movement caught my eye and I started to believe that coding was the future (get outta here chemistry).

Phrases like: "Everyone should learn how to code", "Code to become the next Bill Gates", gave me the impression that coding was a necessary skill everyone needed to know to succeed in the future, or else they would fail. I even wrote about "coding being inevitable" for everyone in my statement when I applied to UWaterloo (looking back, that was super cringe). 

# Why is learning to code such a hot topic? 
Okay but so many more youths are learning how to code, and the movement is only growing in strength. I wondered why and came up with these points:

## accessibility and instant gratification
In developed nations, over [80% of households](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1107826/access-to-computer-in-households-worldwide/) have a personal computer. This makes coding very accessible (a vast improvement from the early ages of computing, where a computer filled a giant room and you had to line up to run your code). Coding also delivers instant gratification. It takes seconds to pull up an online REPL and execute code right in your browser. You don’t even need to understand the code to have something show up; it’s as easy as copying and pasting something from the internet. This is unlike the other sciences. If you want to try out a chemistry experiment you read up on, good luck. Unless your high school or local university has a good supply of chemicals and proper equipment and permits you, there’s a very slim chance of trying out that chemical experiment (and there are more consequences if you screw up the chemical reaction, much less so if you forget a semicolon). 

Thus, coding is quite literally at your fingertips (all you need is a browser) and you can get immediate and instant gratification in seconds. Additionally, the learning curve for HTML is much lower than say physics or chemistry 


## Tech solutionism and hot careers
There’s no marketing initiative as strong as “Learn to Code”. No one is marketing “Learn History” or “Learn Chemistry” because learning history and chemistry does not exactly result in a high-paying career. Teaching someone to code serves capitalistic purposes at the moment, so there’s a huge marketing initiative. It’s cheap to produce a MOOC and sell it to people desperate for a better-paying job, and sometimes the job benefit is instant; you do get a relatively well-paying job to do web development. And there are similar trends, quickly learn about AI to get a job in AI or quickly learn about Web3 and get a job in that area. You rarely ever see this in other areas (like this doesn’t happen in chemistry). I encourage you to read more about [Fast Food Education](https://www.kernelmag.io/pieces/fast-food-education) to learn about the rise of coding/design boot camps and how they uphold the status quo and don't do as they claim (getting more minorities into tech). 

Similar marketing initiatives paint coding as a means to solve all the problems in the world, simply by coding up a website, which I call tech solutionism. There’s also the idea that those who code can “code” up their idea, and are “creators”. This can be a dangerous and harmful mindset to have (see an example [here](https://gizmodo.com/harvard-students-refugee-housing-website-ukraine-take-s-1848708164)). Coding has limitations, and many times coding can introduce problems you would never have with traditional or alternative methods. You can read about my thoughts on tech solutionism in hackathons [here](https://lhao03.github.io/blog/hackathons/#what-are-we-trying-to-solve-here).

# Is teaching everyone to code the right thing to do? 
It’s quite obvious that computers are everywhere. And we should learn about how computers impact us. But is teaching everyone to code the way to understand how this box of metal parts can let us watch videos, help send space shuttles to mars or even just microwave our food (well a microwave isn’t a computer, but there is an operating system inside a [microwave](https://www.hunker.com/12612565/operating-systems-in-microwave-ovens)? I don’t think so. 

After listening to talks from [Simon Peyton Jones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia55clAtdMs) and reading from [Critically Conscious Computing](https://criticallyconsciouscomputing.org/), we should most definitely not be all learning how to code. Instead, we should all be learning about how a computer works. To many, computers are “magical intelligent pieces of metal”. Before you learned about physics, chemistry, math, and biology you might have thought other events were magical, like how baking powder works, how that weird one-sided paper is one-sided, and how sound travels. But through our education, we have all gained some understanding of how these magical events work; baking powder mixed with water produces carbon dioxide bubbles (making your muffins fluffy), the math behind the one-sided paper, and that sound travels in waves. Does just learning to code accomplish one’s desire to understand how a computer works? 

{{ blogImg(img="Mobius.jpg") }}

No, not really. Coding doesn’t tell us anything about how a computer works. It simply lets us tell a computer what we want it to do (thanks to computer scientists who abstracted away a lot of details, it’s easy for anyone to write an easy program now). When you save a text file to your computer do you know how it’s saved on your computer? Coding doesn’t tell you much (if anything). And another question to ponder is how a computer does anything! How does the computer save files and then find them later, what is an operating system and what does it manage and control, how does the computer manipulate incoming information, and much more.
 
# What's computing? 
Computing is the act of performing mathematical or procedural tasks. You don’t need code to compute; all humans can compute! 

Computing is already taught as basic mathematical skills, like learning your time's tables and doing calculations by hand. In university, you then learn it again when you learn about binary and hexadecimal. 

Computing also involves the application of algorithms. How would you introduce an algorithm without code? It can be as simple as telling a group of students to sort themselves (based on height) using a sorting algorithm like bubble sort or merge sort. Then you can ask the students their observations on the different algorithms. 

A computer seems like it’s just doing magic, but it’s computing. The first computers were people (mostly women) during WWII. The abacus can also be seen as a computer. I think that many emerging curriculums do introduce important concepts in computing, so I won’t discuss it much here. If you want to learn more about computing, I recommend watching videos from [Simon Peyton Jones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia55clAtdMs). 

# Why learn about computers? 
I grew up right when social media was just starting to exist. I had to fight my dad to get an email and didn’t even do anything with the email once I got it. Computers weren’t part of my life like reading books was. I didn’t notice or care about computers. 

But computers are now everywhere in society; cars, phones, traffic lights, dishwashers, to just name a few. 

Computers are complex and do many amazing things. It’s easy to view computers as magical. But they aren’t as magical as they seem. Did you know the first computer included wood parts and always broke? Computers were (and are) ever-evolving, which I think is amazing.

## random side thought
I think computers are perhaps a combination of mathematics, physics, and chemistry. 

Mathematics because of a computer’s ability to compute rapidly and without error. 
Physics because of the transfer of information and instructions through electrical signals. 
Chemistry because of the special qualities of metals, rare earth metals, and silicon makes these elements the perfect medium for computing. 

## back to the topic at hand
Even in my university classes, many students don’t recognize that someone, human, like us, designed the computer the way it is today. Computers didn’t magically erect keyboards; it’s not a theory that computers have QWERTY keyboards, someone chose to use QWERTY. Someone is making these choices, and we should understand them because there can be small and large consequences if we don’t. Here are some observations I’ve seen as a Teaching Assistant: 

When I was evaluating final projects in CPSC 210, I would try to run a program, only to see an error saying that a necessary file was missing. When I approached the student about the error, many would show me their program working perfectly fine on their computer.

What happened was that the student was not checking if the project files were the same on their laptop and GitHub (a remote code sharing platform). Since I don’t have access to their computer, I would retrieve the code from GitHub and run it on my machine. However, some files would still be on their computer, usually in the Downloads folder. Since the Downloads folder was not part of their git-tracked directories (essentially, git was not checking the Downloads folder to see if a new file was added), students would tell me “git didn’t tell me to commit this file”. Other similar issues involved the file existing on a student’s Desktop folder, which was also not tracked by git. Another slightly related issue included the use of hard links like “/usr/lucy/myproject/code.java”, which only exists on Lucy’s computer, not Bob’s. All these mistakes involve a misunderstanding or lack of understanding of how a file system works. 

When I ask a student to find their project on their file system, many times, students respond with “what’s the file system” or tell me they have no idea where their project is. Honestly, the first few times I received questions like these I was surprised, but then I started to wonder why students were so unfamiliar with their file system. Even with personal computers becoming more and more common, there are a growing number of students who don’t understand or misunderstand how a [file system works](https://www.theverge.com/22684730/students-file-folder-directory-structure-education-gen-z). I believe that if students were taught about how a computer manages files (which is similar but also different to how a librarian manages books) as part of their secondary education, I’d be receiving a lot fewer questions about file systems. 

Another concept that I also recently learned was about how a computer writes data. When you delete a file or an important pdf, you would probably think it’s gone from your computer. However, in most cases, your deleted file is still there, until it gets overwritten.  All your computer does is keep track of memory that has information. This means after you throw away your computer, you could still have important information on there that you meant to delete! Again, this would have been something students should learn about. Learning to code does very little to help students understand file systems or memory.

Learning about computers doesn't contribute to capitalism like learning to code does; learning about computers should be part of standard education because computers are everywhere and used by most people almost every day. Education should not purely serve to equip a group of people with skills for a career. Education is to help people understand the world around them. This is why we learn science in elementary school. While one can get through the world without understanding Newton’s Laws, resonance structures, and cell biology, it can deepen your understanding of the world, if that is the way you want to view the world. Science is just one way; you can choose to view the world through analogies or historical events. When computers were only for the elite, it would have been pointless to teach the general public about them. But now knowledge of computers should be taught to everyone. 

# ethics and history
Students should also be taught the ethics and history of computers and computing.

[Critically Conscious Computing](https://criticallyconsciouscomputing.org/) gives a wonderful overview of the ethics and history of computing, whether it be how algorithms can oppress, how binary bits reduce people to categories, or how the first computers and operating systems came about. [Design Justice](https://design-justice.pubpub.org/) also gives insight into how choices can harm individuals, and lastly, Programming Inequality discusses how women helped create the field of computing and computers, only to be discarded. These books and their authors explain the area of ethics and history much better than I can in a blog post. I highly recommend you read their works. 

# end
Teaching only code is like only teaching someone lab skills. Learning to just code is very superficial, just like just teaching someone how to pipette. Of course, someone will eventually discover which two reactants will produce the desired product by trial and error, but they will have a lacking understanding to why a chemical reaction works. As the saying goes; “Give a Man a Fish, and You Feed Him for a Day. Teach a Man To Fish, and You Feed Him for a Lifetime”.

Because let’s face it; there are big booms and they always come down. Teaching superficial skills does not always mean these skills will be useful in the future. Tech has gone through many big booms; first C, Java, JavaScript, AI and now Web3. Who knows what is next? But something that will stick with us for a long time is the computer.
