I will admit that I'm someone who comes to quick conclusions on something that I don't know much about. And that's what I did with Twitter. 

## Trump's platform + 280 characters
Twitter to me was the social media platform that helped Trump gain popularity. Additionally, the whole idea of Twitter - expressing your thoughts in less than 280 characters - was scary. I think of random and non sensical thoughts all the time and I'm sure you wouldn't want to read them. Thus, for the year of 2020, I stayed away from Twitter. 

When Trump was finally banned from Twitter, I decided I'd check out Twitter again. It started with reading the tweets made by friends to reading the tweets made by computer science professors. And I was fascinated. Reading a tweet about computer science education and seeing a professor retweet a cat video was so pure and different for me.

Twitter and Reddit are now my favorite social media platforms.
