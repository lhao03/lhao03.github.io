there's a vibe or culture in CS that swes or anyone in tech is doing gods work and people seem to idolise the tech industry. why though. this post is some things I've seen in the CS community. 

# helping society
I've seen many LinkedIn posts start off with how one wishes contribute to society positively, or to help people in general. What follows is a job announcement saying they've accepted a job offer at Facebook/Meta, Snapchat or some other giant tech company. Which is pretty funny to me; we've seen the damage Facebook has done via misinformation about vaccines, COVID 19 and the Holocaust. In fact, Facebook/mEtA knows this, and yet continues to push the same algorithms that throw fuel on the fire (source). Facebook does much more harm to society, so who are you trying to convince when you start off your LinkedIn post saying that you've always wanted to help other people and then announce your internship at FB. 

# the motive behind entering the tech industry
Many people say they are interested in CS or the tech industry because they "like solving problems",  "see CS as the future" or "CS jobs give big money". I'll be honest, I decided to study CS because of the 6 figure salary attached to software engineering. Since doing multidisciplinary studies in microbiology, biology, chemistry and biochemistry, I thankfully no longer hold that reasoning as to why I study computer science. I especially like the interaction between hardware and software, and how we optimise the interface between the two whole upholding the developers trust that by optimization we haven't introduced a bug that explodes in our face later on.  

# uselessness 
And SnapChat is pretty useless. I don't think I need to say much about that one. The truth is, most jobs are useless, especially in the tech industry. Many people probably don't believe me when I say that. That's not to say all jobs in technology are useless, but most are. I thought software engineering was useful too, but through reading conflated LinkedIn posts and advancing through my degree, I realized software engineering gives big money for many people being useless. On the other hand, research in chemistry or microbiology pays absolute shit for work that improves our healt. My internship at Microsoft solidified that view. Microsoft has so many internal projects that my dad likes to say Microsoft throws shit at the wall and sees what sticks. It's true. And my internship project was another "piece of shit" to throw at the wall. It was a "Team's App to help other people build Team's Apps". We even presented the project to a VP in Teams like it was actually something. I tried to switch to the Health and Data/AI team at Microsoft since I didn't want to return under the same team where I felt I was coding with no propose. Since I wasn't able to transfer into the Health and Data/AI team, I rejected the return offer. 

# agile 
Oh and don't get me started on agile, sprints, and starting off user stories with "As a user..", like that's gonna make the user story any more useful. At Microsoft I spent upwards of 4 hours per week with my team planning these user stories and listening in meetings with PMs talking about color schemes and button placements. Instead of improving on old products, most big tech companies just keep pumping out for shit for some theoretical user. Look at Windows 11 and Teams for Life. In Windows 11, they introduced 6 preset tiling options for your applications. But Linux (PopOs) does this, and for free. Windows 11 also featured built in Teams for Life, mimicing Apple's iMessage. I was actually thinking "finally, integrated Teams into Windows!", but then realized only Teams for Life would be integrated, not Teams for Work. Great. 

# old friends 
in high school, most of my friends were set on pursuing an education in health sciences for a career in medicine. I studied, and often helped them with studying in chemistry, writing scholarship essays and more. I'd see the passion flow in their studies and work; one friend had constant eye problems that affected her throughout her life and lived with her elderly grandparents, another friend was the most caring and empathetic and understanding individual who had determination that I don't usually see. 

That's not to say there aren't people "in it for the money" in health sciences. I know someone who played the system by submitting highly inflated IB grades to get into a exclusive undergrad program. 

Okay, so what's this post about? TLDR: most jobs in tech are high paying and useless, people talk about wanting to help others and saying things like tech is the future when neither seem true to me. 

# which stack should I learn?
I've had hackathon attendees and students ask me what they should learn, and 100 percent of the time it's in relation to what the hottest web development technologies are. firstly, I hate JavaScript so I'm the wrong person to ask. additionally, I'm not one to "chase the next hottest thing"
