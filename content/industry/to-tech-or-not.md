I had no idea what I was getting myself into when I set myself on the path of pursuing a major in computer science. there's a vibe or culture in CS that swes or anyone in tech is doing gods work and people seem to idolise the tech industry. why though. this post is some things I've seen in the CS community. 

# helping society
I've seen many LinkedIn posts start off with how one wishes contribute to society positively, or to help people in general. What follows is a job announcement saying they've accepted a job offer at Facebook/Meta, Snapchat or some other giant tech company. Which is pretty funny to me; we've seen the damage Facebook has done via misinformation about vaccines, COVID 19 and the Holocaust. In fact, Facebook/mEtA knows this, and yet continues to push the same algorithms that throw fuel on the fire (source). Facebook does much more harm to society, so who are you trying to convince when you start off your LinkedIn post saying that you've always wanted to help other people and then announce your internship at FB. 

# uselessness 
And SnapChat is pretty useless. I don't think I need to say much about that one. The truth is, most jobs are useless, especially in the tech industry. Many people probably don't believe me when I say that. That's not to say all jobs in technology are useless, but most are. I thought software engineering was useful too, but through reading conflated LinkedIn posts and advancing through my degree, I realized software engineering gives big money for many people being useless. On the other hand, research in chemistry or microbiology pays absolute shit for work that improves our healt. My internship at Microsoft solidified that view. Microsoft has so many internal projects that my dad likes to say Microsoft throws shit at the wall and sees what sticks. It's true. And my internship project was another "piece of shit" to throw at the wall. It was a "Team's App to help other people build Team's Apps". We even presented the project to a VP in Teams like it was actually something. I tried to switch to the Health and Data/AI team at Microsoft since I didn't want to return under the same team where I felt I was coding with no propose. Since I wasn't able to transfer into the Health and Data/AI team, I rejected the return offer. 

# the motive behind entering the tech industry
Many people say they are interested in CS or the tech industry because they "like solving problems",  "see CS as the future" or "CS jobs give big money". I'll be honest, I decided to study CS because of the 6 figure salary attached to software engineering. Since doing multidisciplinary studies in microbiology, biology, chemistry and biochemistry, I thankfully no longer hold that reasoning as to why I study computer science. I especially like the interaction between hardware and software, and how we optimise the interface between the two whole upholding the developers trust that by optimization we haven't introduced a bug that explodes in our face later on.  

# which stack should I learn?
I've had hackathon attendees and students ask me what they should learn, and 100 percent of the time it's in relation to what the hottest web development technologies are. firstly, I hate JavaScript so I'm the wrong person to ask. additionally, I'm not one to "chase the next hottest thing"

To tech or not to tech

I had no idea what I was getting myself into when I set myself on the path of pursuing a major in computer science. But I did notice one sort of culture or vibe: that anyone in tech is doing gods work and people really really like to idolise the tech industry. Why though? The more and more I look and imagine myself in this tech community, the more and more I dislike it. 

# the motive behind entering the tech industry === $$$
Many people say they are interested in CS or the tech industry because they "like solving problems",  "see CS as the future" or "CS jobs give big money". Let's break those down.

## CS jobs give big money
I'll be honest, I decided to study CS because of the 6 figure salary attached to software engineering. 

### which stack should I learn?
I've had hackathon attendees and students ask me what they should learn, and 100 percent of the time it's in relation to what the hottest web development technologies are. firstly, I hate JavaScript so I'm the wrong person to ask. additionally, I'm not one to "chase the next hottest thing"

## Like solving problems
I have the most trouble understanding this reason. Because none of my other academic interests are due to me "liking solving problems" in that domain. 

This reason also leads to tech solutionism. 

## CS is the future
There is a large movement behind gettting every child to code, and this is embodied in phrases like "Coding in the new English" and the like. 

### helping society/having an impact on society
This was another reason I tried to justify doing a degree in computer science. 

I've seen many LinkedIn posts start off with how one wishes contribute to society positively, or to help people in general. What follows is a job announcement saying they've accepted a job offer at Facebook/Meta, Snapchat or some other giant tech company. Which is pretty funny to me; we've seen the damage Facebook has done via misinformation about vaccines, COVID 19 and the Holocaust. In fact, Facebook/mEtA knows this, and yet continues to push the same algorithms that throw fuel on the fire (source). Facebook does much more harm to society, so who are you trying to convince when you start off your LinkedIn post saying that you've always wanted to help other people and then announce your internship at FB.

- gold rush
- startups
- stepping into problem spaces they shouldnt
- not considering power or memory use (not efficient)
- building quick and fast software
- people over tools (bad)
- lower/modest salaries attract people who are truly passionate.
- exploitation of open source
