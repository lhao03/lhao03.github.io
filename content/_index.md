From a self-proclaimed chemistry nerd to {{ inline(text="filter")}} and {{ inline(text="map")}} enthusiast, I found myself studying {{ highlightLink(text="💻 Computer Science", link="https://www.cs.ubc.ca/")}} and {{ highlightLink(text="🧬 Biochemistry", link="https://biochem.ubc.ca/")}} at the {{ highlightLink(text="University of British Columbia", link="https://www.ubc.ca/")}}. While I don't know what I want to do yet, I'm interested in the intersection of healthcare/health sciences and technology, developer tools, and programming languages (for now). If I'm not at my computer coding and eating dark chocolate 🍫, you can find me scrolling through pictures of Shiba Inus 🐕! I also help organize hackathons at {{ highlightLink(text="StarHacks", link="https://www.starhacks.tech/")}} and {{ highlightLink(text="nwPlus", link="https://www.nwplus.io/")}}.

### previously
I've helped design and implement a developer tool to interact with Microsoft Graph at {{ highlightLink(text="Microsoft Garage", link="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/garage/about/")}}, built a {{ highlightLink(text="natural language processing pipeline", link="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.04.21256134v1")}} to automate the extraction of patient information from clinical notes, listened to {{ highlightLink(text="21st Century Girl for 9268 minutes", link="/res/spotify/bts.jpg")}}, led some {{ highlightLink(text="technical workshops", link="/experience")}}, and mentored high schoolers.

### currently
I'll be doing most of my low level computer science courses this year, the last of my math courses, my first biochemistry course (finally done all the biology and chemistry prerequisites) and a third year microbiology course! But before school starts, I'm catching up on webtoons, listening to kpop, eating chocolate and not reviewing calculus 😎. Besides eating too much chocolate, I'm also learning about Elixir! 

### quantified
- kilograms of chocolate consumed per year: 12 🍫
- most weight I've lifted (deadlift): 205 lbs 🏋️‍♀️
- minutes of Spotify in 2020: 37247 🎶
- Shiba Inu pictures on my phone: infinite ∞
