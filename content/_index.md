I dabble at the intersection of molecules, systems and algorithms. I enjoy learning about how and why things work, especially through the lens of physical chemistry. Some questions I have are: 

- how can computation be applied to chemical chaos?
- how can we develop more efficient and accurate methods to predict and simulate chemical properties from first principles?
- and in the meantime, how can we develop scientifically accurate machine learning tools for chemistry?

## About
I'm in my last year of undergrad, currently working with the highly interdisplinary [Hein group](https://groups2.chem.ubc.ca/jheints1/). I contribute to multiple projects in developing automated and autonomous platforms for process chemistry. Learning amongst chemists and engineers had made me really appreciate the work that goes into building and validating robust systems for automating synthethic chemistry. Some of my projects include use the LLMs for generating code for self-driving labs and Bayesian Optimization for HPLC method development.

I've also worked on the implementation of self-consistent field convergence methods in Psi4 with the [Wang group](https://www.chem.ubc.ca/yan-alexander-wang), software and sustainablity efforts for [DNA storage](https://2024.igem.wiki/ubc-vancouver/) and computational biology for [cell-free protein synthesis](https://2023.igem.wiki/ubc-vancouver/) at UBC iGEM, and natural language processing for electronic health records at the [PROOF Centre](https://www.proofcentre.ca/).

Previously I interned in the software industry where I built tools for easier prototyping with the Microsoft Graph API in the Microsoft Garage Program and wrote automated tests for 2FA at Capital One.
