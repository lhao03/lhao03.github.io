I am a noob so these thoughts are not in depth. 

Are computer science degrees the degree most people should go for? 

Chemistry vs. Chemical engineering.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Cruelty_of_Really_Teaching_Computer_Science](Until the end of his life, Dijkstra maintained that the central challenges of computing hadn't been met to his satisfaction, due to an insufficient emphasis on program correctness (though not obviating other requirements, such as maintainability and efficiency))
