** 1: Analytical Concepts & Statistics
1. *Define analytical terminology (e.g., blank, matrix, analyte, assay, quantitative, qualitative)*
   - assay: is process of determining the amount of analyte (substance being measured) in sample
   - analyte: the substance being measured
   - qualitative analysis: (identification)
   - quantitative analysis: (quantity)
   - sample matrix: everything but the analyte
   - blank: chemist made sample that lacks analyte
     - solvent: same solvent as sample solutions
     - method: same solvents and reagents
     - sample: tries to approximate the sample matrix, everything but analyte
2. *Describe figures of merit and use them to characterize and compare methods.*
   - LOD, LOQ
   - accuracy & precision
   - selectivity
     - interferent: chemical that causes systematic error in measured quantity
     - masking agent: prevents components in sample matrix from interfering with analysis
       - analytical method
       - interference with analyte: analyte binds with matrix
       - interference with reagent: matrix binds with reagent
       - background interference
     - sensitivity: determined by slope (how small of a change can be measured)
     - range: concentration range where we have good linearity, accuracy, precision
       - dynamic range: range instrument can measure
     - robustness: ability of method to withstand small, uncontrolled changes in operation parameters
3. Identify potential challenges related to sample collection and preparation.
4. *Calculate the detection limit.*
   - noise: random fluctuations in measured signal
   - blank: a constant (like control) signal measured in absence of analyte
   - limit of detection (LOD): smallest concentration of absolute amount of analyte with signal much larger than blank
     - (signal) LOD: units as signal (instrument maker) $$S_{mb} + z\sigma_{mb}$$
     - (sample) LOD: amount/concentration (user)
       - calibration curve: $$\sigma_{DL} = 3 \sigma_{mb} /m$$
5. *Differentiate between random and systematic sources of uncertainty (error) and explain how repeated measurements can help reduce uncertainty.*
   - absolute error: $$\bar{x} - \mu$$
   - relative error: $$\frac{\bar{x} - \mu}{\mu} \times 100 \%$$
   - random uncertainty: can't replicate, contributes to imprecision => quantify with stats
   - systematic uncertainty: contribute to inaccuracy, repeats, can correct for
     - proportional error: %, issue for large signals
     - constant error: always some absolute value, issue for small signals
6. *Describe how the sample matrix can affect measurements.*
   - matrix effects: combined effect of non-analyte components in sample on measurement of analyte
7. *Explain the 3 methods of calibration: external standards, standard addition and internal standards*
   - external standard: series of solutions of known concentration of analyte
   - standard addition: matrix too complex, so use standard addition
     - prepare standard solutions but with sample and add analyte to "sample"
     - find x-intercept: when y = 0, this is the "original" value of x (without the shift in y axis)
     - the linear line has been "shifted" on the y axis
        [[../../../../../../images/211/standard_addition.jpeg]]
   - internal standard: intentionally add substance that is not expected to be found in sample (not the analyte) but behaves similarly
     - constant amount of internal standard => constant signal
     - changing concentrations of analyte
     - plot ratio between analyte and internal standard vs. ratio of their concentrations $$\frac{S_{A}}{S_{IS}}$$ vs. $$\frac{[A]}{[IS]}$$
8. *Explain the standard addition and internal standard methods of calibration and how they can compensate for certain types of interferences.*
   - external standard:
     - create standard solutions with varying/known conc. of analyte
     - interpolate unknown from CC
     - canâ€™t account for matrix or inconsistencies in instrument
   - standard addition
     - add known quantities of analyte to unknown solution
     - extrapolate unknown from CC
     - accounts for matrix
   - internal standard:
     - add known amount of different (but similar) compound to unknown and standards
     - ratio of signal from analyte to signal from internal standard
9. Interpret or create calibration curves based on external standards, standard additions, or internal standards to determine unknown quantities (e.g., analyte concentration in a sample).
10. Describe the method of least squares in linear regression
11. Apply error propagation and appropriate significant figures in reporting calculated values.
12. *Explain how a Gaussian distribution represents randomly distributed data and forms the basis for confidence limits and statistical tests.*
    - gaussian distribution: bell curve
      - 1sd: 68%
      - 2sd: 95%
      - 3sd: 99%
    - population vs. sample:
      - sample sd approaches population sd as N > 20
      - as N increases, sd decreases
13. *Calculate an average, standard deviation, and confidence limits.*
    - RSD: $$\frac{\sigma}{\bar{x}} \times 100 \%$$
    - CI: probability a difference exists when it doesn't
      - 99% is a larger range than 95% (95% covers smaller area under the guassian distribution)
14. *Select and apply appropriate statistics to test a hypothesis (e.g., comparison of means, comparison of precision, rejection of outliers).*
    - student's t value: permits use of sample data to test hypothesis without knowing population sd
    - significance testing: is difference between two values too large to be explained by random uncertainty
        | case 1 t-test           | case 2 t test               | case 3 t-test       | grubb's test |
        | compare experi. to true | compare two experi. results | compare two methods | outlier?     |
      - case 1 t-test: $$t_{exp} = \frac{|\bar{x} - \mu|\sqrt{N}}{\sigma}$$, and then compare, $$t_{exp} > t_{table}$$ means significant difference
      - case 2 t-test (do two experimental values agree with each other?):
        - same sd: must pool the sds
          - $$\bar{x_1} - \bar{x_2} = +/- t \sigma_{pool} \sqrt{\frac{N_1 + N_2}{N_1N N_2}}$$
            - if LHS < RHS: the 2 means are not statistically different
        - use f-test to determine if two SDs are statistically different: $$\frac{\sigma^2_1}{\sigma^2_2}$$, find F_{exp} and compare with table value => then do the work for different SDs
    - case 3 t-test: paired/matched measurement data
      - comparing single measurements made with two methods on several different samples
      - before and after (drug trials, same people)
    - grubb's test: determine outlier, make sure to remove if it is an outlier

**** An Introduction to Analytical Measurements
- signal
  - visual detection: simple, low-cost, subjective, not sensitive, large sample volumes, low-throughput (??)
  - electrical detection: objective, more sensitive, faster, automate, costly, maintenance, calibration
    - voltage
    - current
    - transducer: converts input stimulus into electrical output
- measurement:
  - signal-to-noise ratio: $$\frac{S}{N}$$ is proportional to $$\sqrt{n}$$
    - averaged signal $$S$$, averaged noise $$N$$
- controls:
  - positive: standard sample with known quantity of analyte
    - prevents situation when there should be a signal but there is no signal (false negative)
  - negative: standard sample with no analyte
    - prevents situation when there should be no signal and there is a signal (false positive)
- sig figs:
  - pH: pH of 2.45, digits after decimal are how many sig figs the conc. has
  - exact number has infinite number of sig figs

** mt1 problems
*** unit 1
- detecting signals that are statistically significant: $$S \geq \mu_{background} + 3 \sigma_{background}$$
- which t-test to use:
  - case 1: compare sample mean with population mean (the true value) (needs replicates)
  - case 2: use the f-test to compare SD of two sample sets, then compare two sample means (needs replicates)
  - case 3: compare methods of single measurements of several different samples
- $$\frac{S}{N}$$ proportionate to $$\sqrt{n}$$
- concentration detection limit: $$S_A = S_{background} + 3\sigma_{background}$$
- what does each standard allow you do to:
  - external standard: interpolate unknown from CC
  - standard addition: extrapolate unknown from CC (matrix effect)
  - internal standard: ratio, add substance similar to analyte, but different and not expected to be found in sample
