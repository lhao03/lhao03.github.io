*** Define electric potential.
  - galvanic: initially positive (electrons want to move from anode to cathode)
    - at eq: potential is 0
    - reflects driving force of redox reaction towards eq
  - half-cell and standard potentials:
    - combo of standard half-cells determine overall cell potential
      - $V_1 < V_2$
        - $V_1$: weak oxidizing agent, less easily reduced
        - $V_2$: stronger oxidizing agent, more easily reduced
      - standard reduction potential: E$_{cell}$ = E$_{cathode}$ - E$_{anode}$
        - $$E^\deg$$ is tabulated for reduction reactions, positive if spontaneous relative to SHE
          - SHE is not easy to work with, use other standards like SCE

*** Draw and label a diagram of a galvanic cell, write the shorthand cell notation for a galvanic cell, and explain the role of each component in galvanic cell.
    - cell types
      - galvanic cell
        - the opposite of electrolytic cell
          - electrons spontaneously go towards positive charge
          - anode (-): electrons leave, so oxidation occurs
          - cathode (+): electrons arrive, reduction occurs
      - electrolytic cell
        - requires electricity
        - electrical energy into chemical energy
        - cell potential is negative
    - salt bridge
      - ensures the solution stays neutral
      - completes circuit
      - need ions with the same hydrated size so that they move at the same rate
      - don't want direct mixing of reduction/oxidation

*** Write the Nernst equation and use it and standard potentials to calculate galvanic cell potentials.
    - Nerst: $$E = E^{o} - \frac{RT}{nF} \ln Q$$,  $$E = E^{o} - \frac{0.0592}{n} \log Q$$
    - for half cell or full reactions
    - $$\Delta G = -nFE$$, where E is potential difference, F is Faraday constant, n is unit charges per molecule
      - maximum work extracted assuming no heat loss
    - we get the Nerst equation by combining the above equation with gibbs equation:
      $$-nFE = -nFE^{\circ} + RT \ln Q \\
      E = E^\circ - \frac{RT}{nF} \ln Q$$
      - when $$K = Q$$, cell potential is 0 and there is no driving force
        - use Nerst equation to find potential at non-standard conditions, replace Q to get:
          $$E = E^\circ - \frac{RT}{nF} \ln \frac{\gamma_C^c [C]^c\gamma_D^d[D]^d}{\gamma_A^a[A]^a \gamma_B^b[B]^b}$$
    - can use Nerst on half and full reactions (for half, if there is solid reactant or product, just least as 1)

*** Explain how potentiometry can be used to determine analyte concentrations.
- instrumentation:
      - analyte solution (with supporting electrolyte)
        - low resistance of solution
          - add more ions to raise the conductivity
      - indicator electrode/reference electrode
        - inert electrodes: respond to redox couples without participating director in reaction
          - stick in solution inert metal picks up potential in solution determined b [Ox] and [Red]
            - Pt, Ag, C
          - better with high surface area
        - work in most circumstances
**** first kind: metal electrode in direct eq with its metal cation
        - $$M^{n+} (aq) + ne^- <-> M (s)$$
        - use in precipitation/complex formation titrations, measure free $M^{n+}$
          - $$E = E^{0}_M + \frac{0.0592}{n} log a_M = E^{0}_M - \frac{0.0592}{n} pM$$
            - slow kinetics
            - poor selectivity (bad in natural solutions)
            - oxides may form on solid metal
**** second kind: add in another eq, Ksp: responds to ion that form insoluble salt with the metal
        - $$E = E^{0}_{AgCl} + \frac{0.0592}{1} log a_{Cl} = E^{0}_{AgCl} - \frac{0.0592}{n} pCl^-$$
          - measured voltage responds to [Cl-]
          - indirectly measure free $M^{n+}$
        - electrode of first kind coupled to $K_{sp}$ equilibrium
          1. write nerst equation as if is the first electrode
          2. add Ksp, which can be expressed as activity or concentration: substitute activity of metal with Ksp and chloide ion
             $$E = E^{0}_{AgCl} - \frac{0.0592}{1} log \frac{1}{\frac{K_{sp}}{[Cl^{-1}]}}$$
             - potential varies with concentration of chloride
               - if [Cl-] is fixed, potential is fixed
        - what happens if push alot of current through electrode, keep giving electrons -> make Cl$^-$
          - Cl$^-$ will precipiate -> run of AgCl, run of K (for KCl precipitating the Cl), then you lose the eq -> the potential of reference electrode starts changing and no longer reference electrode
            - can't push alot of current through them
        - salt bridge
        - voltmeter (large resistance to minimize loading error)
          - voltage is occurring at bottom, want to show potential happening at bottom
          - $V = IR$ if you have voltage drop at voltmeter, the measured voltage is lower than in solution
            - if R is large, current is very small, so voltage drop is very small -> loading error
              - happens if current is nontrivial
                - voltage between two electrodes, some resistance in overall circuit -> determines ions
          - in voltmeter, there is a resistance, not the same as the one in the whole circuit
            - voltage drop = current * resistance of voltmeter
            - only one current that is very very small

*** Describe how a redox titration can be used to determine the concentration of an analyte,
    - titrated with strong ox. or red. agent to determine analyte
    - strong, standardized ox/red agent
    - assume redox reactions go to completion
      - eq point: amount oxi/red added is equal to amount of analyte
      - endpoint: observable change that signals eq point
    - endpoint determined through
      - tracking changes in potential
      - redox indicator dye (indirect)
      - change in solution color (direct)
    - pretreatment:
      - analytes can exist in different oxidation states -> analytes need to be single oxidation state
      - auxiliary/reducing agents: preoxi or prered of samples
        - agent must be easy to remove
      - auxiliary reducing agent: solid metal, flow solution through burrete
      - auxiliary oxidizing agent: bismuthates (insoluble, filter to remove), hydrogen peroxide or peroxydisulfate (heat up to decompose)
    - typical reducign agent
      - ferrous ion:
        - add excess Fe2+ to analyte solution
        - back titrate
      - iodine/sodium thiosulfate
        - treat analyte with excess iodide
        - back titrate with thiosulfate
    - typical oxidizing agent
      - permanganate ion:
        - reduced ti various species with non-voilet color
        - ceric ion
        - dichomate ion
    - what's at EQ and what not?
      - beaker at EQ: will come into EQ
      - reference electrode is not at EQ, only electrically in contact with beaker, not chemically, it is there as a reference
        - need something to not be at eq or we get zero potential!
        - need one redox reaction not at eq
*** calculate the concentration of the unknown from redox titration data,
    - titration curve:
      - looks like acid/base curve
      - measure voltage between ref and insert electrode to moniter titration
      - initial potential close to that of titrand half cell
        - lower
        - because only have some species in solution
    - final potential close to that of titrant half cell
    - remember in redox couples, there needs to be one reaction (at least) not at equilibrium for there to be a measureable potential
      - also reference electrode can't completely mix with solution
[[../../../../../../images/211/redox_titration.png]]
    - at the start: not at standard conditions because the concentrations are different
      - figure out approximate starting region
    - potential of half-equiv point, after equiv point, at equiv point
    - all vs. SHE or another reference electrode
      - you find out all of this with the Nerst equation
*** and calculate the cell potential at different points during a redox titration.
    - example problem: consider $$Fe^{2+} + Ce^{4+} <-> Fe^{3+} + Ce^{3+}$$
      - cell: SHE || Fe^{2+}  Ce^{4+} Fe^{3+} Ce^{3+} | Pt
      - potential: $$E_{system} = E_{Fe} = E_{Ce}$$
      - reference electrode separated by salt bridge, Pt in solution
      - write Nerst equations: one for Fe, one for Ce both as reduction
        - can use either, will get same answer
          - one is easier to use before eq point, one is easier to use after eq point
        - before eq point: still contains $$Fe^{2+}$$, so use the analyte reduction half-reaction
        - at eq point: equal concentrations, we know [Fe$^{3+}$] = [Ce$^{3+}$] and [Fe$^{2+}$] = [Ce$^{2+}$],
          - so equate them to get: $$E = 1/2 (E_{Fe}^, +E_{Ce}^,)$$, only if both reactions involve same n, and activities have to cancel
          - can use both Nerst equations
        - after eq point: all iron is Fe3+, and moles Ce3+ equal moles Fe3+
          - contains known excess of unreacted titration Ce4+ => use titrant reduction half-reaction, find concentrations of Ce4+/Ce3+
      - sharper/clearer endpoint when: larger difference in reduction potential of titrant and titrand (larger E means more spontaneous, larger neg delta G) -> goes further towards completion
        - 1:1 stoich: symmetric about equiv point
          - otherwise: assynmetric when not 1:1

*** Describe the design and use of reference electrodes, including drawing simple diagrams of common reference electrodes.
  salt bridges are built into reference cell
  - SCE: paste of mercury and calomel (Hg$_{2}$Cl_{2}$)
    - KCl filling solution
    - Hg$_{2}$Cl_{2}$ (s) + 2e$^-$ -> 2Hg (l) + 2Cl$^{-}$
      - when Cl concentration increases, you crash out KCl?
      - [Cl^${-}$] essentially constant
      - at 25C, E$^{o}$ = 0.244 V for saturated KCl
  - Silver/SilverChloride
    - silver wire with layer of AgCl
    - KCl filling solution:
      - AgCl (s) -> Ag (s) + Cl$^{-}$
        - at 25C, E$^{o}$ = 0.197 V for saturated KCl
        - at 25C, E$^{o}$ = 0.205 V for 3.5 M KCl
  - half-cell potentials (different reference electrode):
    [[../../../../../../images/211/number-line.png]]

*** Describe the origin of membrane potentials and their analytical utility in different types of ion selective electrodes.
- separation of charge: associated electric potential
  - gauss law: electric potential proportional to charge density
  - liquid junction potential: potential that develops across ion permable boundry between different electrolyte solutions
- membrane potential: effect of surface groups
    [[../../../../../../images/211/membranepotential.png]]
    - charge on surface varies with pH
    - negative charge on surface attract positive charge -> double layer
      - [[../../../../images/211/double.png]]
      - separation of charge at double-layer creates membrane potential, $E_m$
        - magnitude depends on charge on membrane
- if membrane is thin and conductive, difference between two membrane potentials can be measured as boundry potential $E_b$
  - boundary potential: $E_b = E_1 - E_2$
    - determined by pH (different pH of solutions will charge glass differently)
- glass as a membrane
  - amorphous SiO_2
  - no long range structure (glass is a state)
  - cooled to rigidity without crystallization
    - soda used as flux to lower melting temperature in manufacture
    - lime used to prevent glass from dissolving
  - have some mobility, slightly conductive
  - irregular arrangement of SiO4 tetrahedra
  - incomplete bonding: Si-O groups associated with cations
    - can hydrate surface layer; exchange monovalent ions for protons
      - binding of hydrogen ions more strongly favored than alkali metal cations
- Na and H ions conduct in hydrated outer layers (10nm) of glass membrane
  - Na conducts electricity in dry interior (0.1nm)
    [[../../../../../../images/211/membranee.png]], which is more negative charged side? higher pH side

*** Draw and label a diagram of a glass/pH electrode. Explain the principles of its operation and its sensitivity to pH.
[[../../../../../../images/211/glassph.png]]
- in low pH, hydrogen binds the silicon groups, displacing sodium ions
  - sodium ions carry charge across glass membrane

*** lecture 14
**** glass as membrane
- arrangement of $SiO_4$ tetrahedra, bonding is incomplete $Si-O^-$ groups associated with cations
  - $Na^+ Gl^- (s) + H_3O^+ (aq) <> H^+ Gl^-1 (s) + H_2O + Na^+ (aq)$
- Charge on glass surface depends on two EQ: with $H^+$ and with $Na^+$ (or other alkali metals)
  - binding of hydrogen ions is more favored than alkali metal ions
  - pH sensitivity:
    - exterior solution: $Na^+$ conducts in dry interior
    - interior solution: $Na^+$ and $H^+$ conducts in hydrated outer layers of glass
    - This complicates relating potential to [$H^+$]
- potentiometric measurement:
  - analyte solution, indicator electrode, reference electrode, salt bridge, voltmeter
**** Ion-selective Electrodes /Introduction to Spectrophotometry
- PM with ISE require:
- Combination pH electrodes combine 2 reference electrodes plus glass membrane
  - Measured potential is the membrane potential, and varies with analyte [$H^+$]

*** Write and apply the Nikolsky equation.
- There is no Nernst Eqn for potentiometry (since no charge transferred, ie no redox rxn)
  - But we can write a ‘Nernst‐like’ equation
- You can’t use a pH electrode without first calibrating it
- Measurements go wonky at very high pH (very basic solns)
  - Interference from Na^+
  - Nikolsky eqn quantifies interference
- What Liquid membrane ISEs and Solid State ISEs are and how they work

*** Draw diagrams and explain the principles of operation of liquid membrane and solid-state ISEs.
[[../../../../../../images/211/solidstate.png]]
- membrane consists of inorganic salt or single crystal of inorganic salt
[[../../../../../../images/211/liquid.png]]
- use of ionophore, hydrophobic membrane with liquid organic

**** misc. things from lecture
- what is electrochemistry: electrical measurements of chemical systems
  - inexpensive equipment, can measure complex samples with little sample prep
- reducing/oxidizing:
  - reducing agent: is oxidized, so ON increases, and electrons are lost
  - oxidizing agent: is reduced, so ON decreases, and electrons are gained
- ions in solution: concentration vs activity
  - ions interact electrostatically
  - can interact with other things in solution that have charge
  - other ions can partially shield the ions of interest (like Ca$^2+$ and SO$_4^{2-}$)
    - this means $K_{sp}$ gets larger with more salt added (NaCl also partially sheild), takes more CaSO4 to dissolve in water as you add more NaCl -> activity
**** activity
- value of concentration equilibrium constants increase at high electrolyte concentration
  - what does this mean chemically: there is more of the ion product in solution
  - concentration equilibrium constants don't consider other dissolved ions and their electrostatic interations and ion-ion interactions
    - solubility increases???
- activity coefficients: $$a_i = \gamma_i c$$
  - decrease as ionic strength increases
  - thermodynamic eq constant is written in terms of activities
- can ignore for very dilute solutions
**** ionic strength
- the net effect of dissolved electrolytes: $$\mu = \frac{1}{2} \Sigma_i c_i z^2_i$$
  - $$\mu \propto c_i, z_i$$
    - monovalent < divalent < trivalent
      - thus for monovalent salts, ionic strength equals molarity
      - for other salts, ionic strength > molarity
**** activity in dilute solutions
- for neutral molecules, activity coefficient is 1
- for ions: use the debye-huckel limiting law (useful for when ionic strength is less than 0.005 M at 25 C):
  $$log \gamma_i = -0.51 z^2_i \sqrt{\mu}$$
- extended: requires temperature dependent coefficients and effective diameter of hydrated ion
- free energy and potential
  - delta G: for electrochemical rxn: maximum work that can be extracted
    $$\Delta G = -nFE$$
    - galvanic: positive potential
    - electric: negative potential
    - 0 potential: no driving force
- formal electrode potentials:
  - most redox analyses done at high ionic strength ($\mu \geq 0.1$M), so activity coefficients cannot be readily calculated (D-H doesn't work well here, can't calculate range that chemists work in)
    - need to worry about concentration and activity
    - use formal electrode potentials
      - say what the conditions are (empirical potential for half-cell under specific set of conditions)
- $$E = E^{0'} - \frac{RT}{nF} ln \frac{[C]^c[D]^d}{[A]^a[B]^b}$$, where $$E^{0'}$$ is the formal potential
  - specifying unit concentrations vs. unit activities
  - or nature of supporting electrolyte, pH, ionic strength, temperature
  - differ from standard potential by up to hundreds of millivolts

- diffusion of cation and anion at different rates
  - ions are different sizes, so they diffuse at different rates
        [[../../../../../../images/211/ljp.png]]
  - pick ions with similar size hydrated radius size
