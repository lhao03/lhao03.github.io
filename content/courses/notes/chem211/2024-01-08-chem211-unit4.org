**  Explain how different wavelengths of light interact with matter, including the concept of resonance, different types of transitions, chromophores/auxochromes, and selection rules.
- resonance: energy matching
- quantum yield: fraction of excited states that do emit photon
- chromophore: light absorbing groups (part of molecule)
  - 200 - 800 nm: pi-electron and hetero atoms with non-bonding valence shell electron pairs
  - non bonding electrons in water, alcohols, either don't absorb above 160nm, they are suitable solvents for spectroscopy
    - increasing/extending conjugation of unsaturated bonds decreases transition energies -> energy gap between HOMO and LUMO decreases
- auxochrome: chemical group attached to chromophore that modifies its light absorption (alter energy of MOs)
  - acid-base indicators: isobestic point -> total absorbance stays the same (?)
- non-boding electrons in O of water, alcohol, ether are good solvents for UV/Vis (don't absorb above 160)

| Nature of Shift    | Term         | How                                          |
|--------------------+--------------+----------------------------------------------|
| longer wavelength  | red shift    | adding double bonds                          |
| shorter wavelength | blue shift   |                                              |
| greater absorption | hyperchromic | doubles with each new conjugated double bond |
| lower absorption   | hypochromic  |                                              |

- HOMO LUMO transitions:
  - in the UV/Vis range
  - singlet state:
    - ground: two electrons opposing spin, same orbital
    - excited: two electrons opposing spin, different orbitals

**  Draw and label a Jablonski energy level diagram and relate its features to absorption spectra.
- Bandwidths also depend on local environment (including effect of vib. & rotational levels)
  - we get absorption bands from electronic transitions, vibrational levels, rotational levels, other collections/interaction

**  Describe the processes that occur when UV-visible light is absorbed by a molecule, including excited states and relaxation processes.
- Relaxation pathways: fluorescence, internal conversion, intersystem crossing, phosphorescence
    - vibrational relaxation: energy lost to heat, electron stays in same electronic state
    - internal conversion: energy lost to heat, electron moves to lower electronic state, requires overlap between vibration levels and lower electronic state (horizontal energy transfer)
    - fluorescence: only occurs in singlet to singlet state
    - intersystem crossing: excited singlet move to excited triplet (or other way)
    - phosphorescence: only occurs in triplet to singlet state
    - light emitted from fluorescence or phosphorescence is always same or less than excitation wavelength
    - relative time frame:
      - absorption < vibration relaxation and internal conversion < fluorescence < phosphorescence (slow)

** Explain the differences between atomic and molecular absorption spectra.
*** UV/Vis spectra for molecules/ions
- difference in energy between HOMO and LUMO -> UV/Vis, absorption of photon is possible
- types of transitions, n is non bonding:
  - $$\sigma \rightarrow \sigma^*$$, 200 nm
  - $$n \rightarrow \sigma^*$$, 160-260 nm
  - $$\pi \rightarrow \pi^*$$, 200-500 nm
  - $$n \rightarrow \pi^*$$, 250-600 nm
- charge transfer: inorganic metal-ligand complexes, electron from metal transferred to ligand -> produce very large absorbance
- UV/Vis more broad than IR
  - UV/Vis absorption results in change to electronic energy levels and maybe vibrational -> number of closely spaced absorption bands that merge together to form single broad absorption band
 - IR absorption only results in change to vibrational energy levels
*** UV/Vis spectra for atoms
- enough energy to cause change in atom's valence electrons
- only allowed between $l +-1$$
- excited state lifetime is short
- narrow width in absorption lines, due to fixed difference in energy and lack of rotational/vibrational energy levels (width is $$10^{-5} - 10^{-3}$$ nm)

**  Explain the significance of the terms in the Beer-Lambert Law, and how they relate to molecular features and experimental design.
- light absorption: by chromophores, reflection, scattering loss
- molar absorption coefficient + path length => slope => sensitivity

**  Explain the limitations of Beer’s Law.
- real deviations:
  - high concentration: chromophores affect charge distribution of other chromophores
  - epsilon dependson refractive index
- apparent deviations:
  - light is not perfectly monochromatic

**  Utilize Beer’s Law for determining the concentration of one or more analyte species from one or more absorbance measurements.
- mixtures: $$A_{total} = A_1 + A_2 + ... = b (\epsilon_1 c_1 + \epsilon_2 c_2) + ... $$
- $$A_{\lambda 1} = b (\epsilon_{1 \lambda 1} c_1 + \epsilon_{2 \lambda 1} c_2) + ...$$,  $$A_{\lambda 2} = b (\epsilon_{1 \lambda 2} c_1 + \epsilon_{2 \lambda 2} c_2) + ...$$
  - etc for the other wavelengths
**  Relate the choice and arrangement of components in a spectrophotomer to its capabilities, performance, advantages and disadvantages. Draw and label a detailed block diagram of a spectrophotometer, including the light path and components, and describe the function of each of those components.
*** single beam instrument
1. light source
   - D (UV)
   - T (Vis)
   - glass absorbs wavelength less than 350 nm, quartz absorbs below 190 nm
2. wavelength selector
   - diffraction grating, prism, filter
     - diffraction grating equation: $$a-b = m \lambda = d (sin (i) + sin (r))$$
       - where:
         - d: groove spacing (related to lines/mm)
         - i: incident angle
         - r: reflection angle
         - m: order (use filters to block unwanted)
   - monochromator: slit, diffraction grating, slit
     - narrow slit => S/N decreases, but bandwidth more narrow
     - double monochomator: reduce stray light + improve linearity => throughput decreased
       - does not remove unwanted orders (need filter)
       - slit => grating => slit => grating => slit
   - groove density increases (lines/mm) => dispersion increases => resolution increases => working range decreases (PDA detector)

**  Describe the operation of key components for measuring absorbance:
*** Light sources (tungsten, deuterium)
- D (UV)
- T (Vis)
***  Monochromators (gratings and slits)
- filters have a fixed wavelength
- if we want to make measurements at different wavelengths -> need more than one filter
- monochromator: select narrow band of radiation, allow for continuous adjustment of band's nominal wavelength
  - nominal wavelength: the wavelength you want?
    - want high throughput of radiation and narrow effective bandwidth
[[../../../../../../images/211/nominal.jpg]]
[[../../../../../../images/211/monochomator.png]]
- collimating mirror: collects radiation
  - reflects parallel beam of radiation to diffraction grating
- differaction grating: optically reflecting surface with large number of parallel grooves
  - disperses radiation -> focused onto planar surface that contains exit slit
  - or prism
- converts polychromatic source of radiation to monochromatic source of finite bandwidth
- exit slit:
  - narrow: smaller effective bandwidth and better resolution, but smaller throughput of radiation
- can be fixed-wavelength or scanning
  - fixed: manually select wavelength by rotating grating

***  Sample cells (design and materials)
- glass (silicate): 400 - 2000
- glass (optical): 350 - 2000
- quartz: UV 200 - 3000
- plastic: vis only, 380 - 780

***  Photodetectors (PMT, photodiode, photodiode arrays)
- not equally sensitive to all wavelengths
  - measuring reference can help
- PMT
  - photoelectric effect: signal amplification with electron cascade
    - photocathode => focussing electrode => dynode(s) => anode
    - more dynodes => more sensitive
    - not equally sensitive to all wavelengths
- silicon photodiode
  - PN-junction in silicon
  - voltage is created
    - proportional to incident light intensity
- PDA (made of photodiode)
  - entire spectrum measured
  - PDA replaces exit slit => each PN element is a slit
  - don't have great S/N

** misc notes
textbook notes:
- if energy ($$\hbar v$$) of photon is more than excited state - ground state, excitation occurs
- atom/molecule in excited state can emit photon of energy $$\hbar v$$
- you don't see the colors a substance absorbs
*** spectroscopy based on absorption
- absorbed wavelength intensities are attenuated
- for an analyte to absorb EMR:
  - there must be mechanism which EMR interacts with analyte -> UV/Vis changes energy of electrons, IR -> bond vibrational energy
  - photon energy must equal different in energy between two allowed energy states
**** IR spectra for molecules for polyatomic molecules:
- energy for allowed vibration mode: $$E_v = v + \frac{1}{2} h v_o$$
  - fundamental: +/- 1
  - overtone: +/- 2,3
******* transmittance and absorbance
- transmittance: $$$T = \frac{P_T}{P_0}$
[[../../../../../../images/211/p.png]]
- redefine $P_0$ from blank so we don't need to care about loss of light from the source
- absorbance is linear function of analyte concentration: $$A = -log T = - log \frac{P_T}{P_0}$$
  - require line source instead of continuum source because effective bandwidth is too large
