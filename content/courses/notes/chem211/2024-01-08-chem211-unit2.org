** 2: Equilibrium and Volumetric Analysis
1. Recognize compounds that participate in equilibrium reactions or otherwise have an effect on those reactions (e.g., acids, bases, ions that form insoluble or sparingly salts, ligands).
2. *Define the following terms mathematically and in your own words: Ka, Kb, Kw, Ksp, Kf, Kd.*
   - $$K_b = \frac{[BH^+][OH^-]}{[B]}$$
   - $$K_a = \frac{[A^-][H_3O^+]}{[HA]}$$
   - $$K_w = K_a K_b$$
   - $$K_{sp} = [A^+]^a [B^-]^b$$, solid dissolving into ions
   - $$K_f$$: formation, ions forming into another ion
3. *Write mass balance, charge balance and solubility expressions for an equilibrium problem.*
   - systematic treatment of equilibrium
     - as many equations as unknowns
     - chemical equilibrium constant expressions
     - charge balance charge on cation_1[cation_1] + charge on cation_2[cation_2] = charge on anion_1[anion_1] + charge on anion_2[anion_2], include every single ion
   - formal: moles of original chemical formula in solution, without regard for species that already exist
   - how to use:
     - mass balance: if you're looking for a species, check if you set up a mass balance for it, or if you need to sub an unknown
     - charge balance: not sure
     - chem eq: to sub in an unknown
4. Relate physical constants (Ka, Kb, Ksp, Kf) to trends in the shape of titration curves and distribution diagrams.
5. Select an appropriate method of endpoint detection and/or indicator (from a limited group of options) for a given analysis and justify your choice.
   - equiv points:
     - strong acids: 7
     - weak acids: pH = pK$_{a}$ at half-equiv point
     - endpoints for polyprotic species:
       - if $$\frac{K_{a,1}}{K_{a,2}}$$ larger than or equal $$10^{4}$$, 1st endpoint will be clear (endpoint can disappear into the other)
       - if $$pK_{a,2}$$ less than or equal 8, 2nd endpoint will be clear (if larger than 8, then $$K_{a2}$$ too weak)
       - triprotic: third endpoint around 12.7, too small, can't see
   - selecting indicators: pK$_a$ of indicator that is close to expected pH at equivalance point
     - for weak acid pK$_a$ is only half-equiv, so need an indicator that has much higher pK$_a$
       [[../../../../../../images/211/indicators.jpg]]
   - how to ensure we see the change of color in indicator?
     - strong acid: eq point occurs at 7, very steep, the steep portion is almost vertical
     - weak acid: $P_{ka}$ of indicator much larger than $P_{ka}$ of weak acid, or indicator changes color too early because not as steep (?), since eq point occurs after pH 7
     - weak base: eq point occurs before 7
6. *Write the equilibrium expression(s) for a complexation titration*
   - $$M^{m+} + L^{n-} <-> ML^{m-n}$$
     - $$K_f = \frac{ML^{m-n}}{[M^{m+}][L^{n-}]}$$
7. *Qualitatively predict the consequences of disturbing a system at equilibrium (e.g., adjustment of pH, changes in concentration, or the addition of new species).*
   - pH on solubility: using Le Chatelier
     - pH increases: adding hydroxide to equation
     - pH decreases: adding hydronium to equation
   - complexing agent: increases solubility
8. Identify relevant equations and make appropriate assumptions to quantitatively analyze an equilibrium system.

*** misc. info from lectures
- activity
  - weak acid and weak base
- polyprotic acid
  - formulas:
    - $$[H^+] = \sqrt{\frac{K_{a2}[HA^-] + K_w}{1 + \frac{[HA^-]}{K_{a1}}}}$$
    - $$[H^+] = \sqrt{K_{a2}K_{a1}}$$
    - $$pH = 1/2(pK_{a1} + pK_{a2})$$ this is also how you get isoelectric point
    - amphiprotic substance
- Henderson-Hasselbalch Equation: $$pH = pK_a + log \frac{[A^-]}{[HA]}$$
- diprotic acid with strong base (how to calculate pH throughout the titration process): (REVIEW)
  - buffer region: H-H equation
  - compare $K_a$s
- buffers
  - effective range: $$pK_a +- 1$$
- gravimetric methods
  - obtain analyte by precipitating it
- precipitation titration
  - titrant: $$AgNO_{3}$$
  - argentometric titrations:
    - free $[Ag^+]$ decreases with small value of $K_{sp}$
      - small $K_{sp}$ means bigger number in demoninator (more ppt), pAg is larger
    - for titrating: anything that is insoluble when reacted with  silver
      - endpoint: can be measuring removed or excess
        fluorescein:
        - titration of halides
        - before eq point: colloidal AgX is neg
        - after eq point: colloidal AgX is pos
        - it depends on the ratio between $Ag^+$ and $X^-$ which determines its charge
        - titration graph: after eq point, all indicators converge to the same behaviour
        - "colloid is a mixture in which one substance consisting of microscopically dispersed insoluble particles is suspended throughout another substance"
- EDTA titration
  - how to deal with EDTA titrations at other pH:
    - $$\alpha_6 = \frac{[Y^{4-}]}{C_{EDTA}}$$
    - from $$M^{n+} + Y^{4-} \Leftrightarrow MY^{(n-4)+}$$, we get $$K_f = \frac{[MY^{(n-4)+}]}{[M^{n+}] \alpha_6 c_{EDTA}}$$
  - complexing agent: EDTA at basic pH
  - for titrating: metal
  - pH dependence: as pH increases, amount of unbound metal decreases
    - auxiliary complexing agent: ammonia to complex cations and maintain solubility at basic pH
      - ACA needs larger binding constant than EDTA but smaller formation constant
      - why need basic pH? because many metals precipitate as hydroxoides if pH is too high
      - concentration of $$Y^{-4}$$ is the most at basic pH (it is pH dependent)
        - to use a lower pH: need $$\alpha_6$$, defines mole fraction of $$Y^{-4}$$ at given pH
          - rewrite MY formation to use $$\alpha_6 c_{EDTA} = [Y^{-4}]$$
            - this gives a conditional formation constant: $$K^'_f (pH) = \alpha_6 K_f$$
        - too much ACA decreases sharpness of endpoint
          $$M^{2+} + 4NH_3 \Leftrightarrow Zn(NH_3)_4^{2+}$$
          $$Zn(NH_3)_4^{2+} + Y^{4-} \Leftrightarrow ZnY^{2-} + 4NH_3$$
- indicators for EDTA:
  - Eriochrome Black T: only works on some metals, can use backtitration to use with other metals
    - orange to red/violet
- complex titrations
  - add masking agents to hide certain metals, needs to have stronger $$K_f$$ than EDTA
  - demasking agent: another metal that binds with masking agent
  - auxillary complexing agent: keep metal in solution
- indirect titration
  - if titration is slow
  - no suitible indicator
  - no useful direct titration reaction
    - you can add A + B, with B in known excess
      - measure leftover B with C
  - applications: volhard titration
    - titrant: $SCN^-$
    - determine: $Ag^+$
    - find out how much halide
    - indicator: $Fe^{+3}$
    - need to ensure $K_f_{AgSCN} > K_f_{FeSCN}$
    - back titration for halide determination
      - titrate with halide solution with excess Ag
        - when all the Cl has been bound, you have Ag in excess
        - start titrating the excess Ag with Fe. You add SCN until the solution turns red -> endpoint
      - SCN^- turns red at first instance of excess SCN^- by reacting with iron
    - displacement titrations
      - want to analyse a metal with EDTA, but if the matrix is unknown, other metals may bind to EDTA that is not the metal of interest
      - instead, react $$Ca^{2+}$$ with $$MgY^+$$; $$Ca^{2+}$$ has higher $K_f$ will displace $$Mg^{2+}$$
        - titrate the freed $$Mg^{2+}$$ in solution ? we titrate the excess Mg with EDTA?


** mt1 problems
*** unit 2
- solubility equilibria: will precipiate form? check if $$Q > K_{sp}$$ using the equation $$[M^+][X^-]$$
- solubility equilibria: with x mL 0.y M of $$MY$$ added to x mL of 0.j M $$NaI$$, how much ppt forms and what is the final concentration
  1. set up reaction equations:
     $$MI \Leftrightarrow M^+ + I^-$$
     $$MY + NaI \leftarrow MI + NaY$$
  2. set up $$K_{sp} = [M^+][I^-]$$, find $[I^-]$
     - assume $$[M^+] = 0$$ at eq, so to find $[I^-]$, you subtract concentration of M from total concentration of I, then solve for M
- complexation equilibria: what is the concentration of $$M^{2+}$$ when x.0 mL of 0.00y M $$MCl_2$$ is added to z.0 mL of 0.00j M of EDTA at pH 13.0
  1. set up ice table with starting concentrations, and $$K_f$$ expression
  2. mass balance with known concentrations
  3. assume because of large $$K_f$$, $$[M^{2+}] = 0$$
- solubility equilibria: solubility of $$CoCO_3$$ in buffered solution of pH 4.0
  1. set up equations for $$K_{sp}$$, $$K_{a1}$$, $$K_{a2}$$
  2. set up mass balance, one for the $$[Co^{2+}] = ...$$ and $$[CO_3^{2-}] = ...$$ and one for the acids
  3. using known values, substitute and solve for $$[Co^{2+}]^2$$

  1. given $$K_{sp}$$ and $$K_f$$, write two equations for each one
  2. set up mass balance for $[M^+]$ and $[CN^-]$
  3. list assumptions:
     - since $$K_f$$ is large, there is not much free $M+$
     - MCl will dissolve until all $CN^-$ used up: $$[M(CN)_2^-] >> [CN^-]$$
       - $$[CN^-]_i = 2[M(CN)_2^-] = 0.0x$$ M
       - $$[Ag^+]_i = [Cl^-]_i = [M(CN)_2^-]$$
- $$XCl$$ is dissolved in a solution of 0.x M $$ACl$$, where $$ACl$$ is soluble and $$XCl$$ is not very soluble. Given $$K_{sp} = [X^+][Cl^-]$$
  1. find equations: $$ACl \Leftrightarrow A^+ + Cl^-$$
  2. set up mass balance: 0.x M = $$[A^+] = [Cl^-]_{total} - [Cl^-]_{XCl} = [Cl^-]_{total} - [X^+]$$
     - because $$[Cl^-]_{XCl} = [X^-]$$
  3. set up charge balance (include all ions): $$1[Na^+] + 1[X^+] = 1[Cl^-]$$
  4. check number of unknowns is equal to number of equations

- indirect titration of A with excess and known B and X: BX binds, then with addition of A, released B is amount of A
  - A has higher $$K_f$$ then B
- EDTA titration at pH lower than 10: what is the concentration of $$M^{2+}$$ when x.0 mL of 0.00y0 $$MCl_2$$ is added to z.0 mL of 0.0j M EDTA solution buffered at pH k?
  1. set up $$K_f$$ expression: $$K_f = \frac{[CaY^{2-}]}{[M^{+2}][Y^{4-}]}$$
  2. set up mass balance:
     $$[EDTA] = \frac{z \times 0.0j \text{ M}}{x + z}$$
     $$[MY^{2-}] = \frac{x \times 0.0y \text{ M}}{x + z}$$ assuming all the EDTA forms complex with the metal.
  3. sub in alpha: $$[Y^{4-}] = \alpha_6 [EDTA]_{free}$$
     $$[EDTA]_{free} = [EDTA] - [MY^{2-}]$$
  4. sub in known values into the $$K_f$$ expression to find the concentration of $$M^{2+}$$
     $$[M^{2+}] = \frac{K_f \alpha_6 [EDTA]_{free}}{[MY^{2-}]}$$
- argentometric titration before eq point: x mL of 0.0y M XCl was titrated with 0.z M of $$AgNO_3$$
  - find pCl at 10 mL of $$AgNO_3$$:
    1. calculate how much $$Ag^+$$ has been added; this is how much $Cl^-$ has formed ppt with silver
    2. subtract $Cl^-$ that has formed complex with $Ag^+$ from initial amount of chlorine
    3. $$pCl = log[Cl^-]$$
- argentometric titration at eq: use $$K_{sp}$$
- argentometric titration after eq: calculate excess $$Ag^+$$, then sub into $$K_{sp}$$ expression and solve for $$[Cl^-]$$
