* ch 1: numerical algorithms
- mathematical model: formulated as an attempt to explain/understand
- continuous/piecewise problem approximated by discrete one
- functions approximated by finite arrays
- algorithms solve mathematical problems
- numerical analysis is the theory behind such algorithms

** 1.2 error
- absolute error: $$|u - v|$$
- relative error: $$|u - v|/|u|$$

*** error types
1. errors in the problem to be solved:
   - approximation errors in the mathematical model
   - errors in input data
2. approximation errors
   - discretization errors: diecretization of continuos process
   - convergence errors: arise in iterative methods, since nonlinear problems can be solved by infinitely many iterations
3. roundoff errors
   - due to finite precision representation of real numbers on computers
*** Big-O Notation
