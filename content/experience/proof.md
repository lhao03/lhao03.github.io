Redesigned a fragile natural language processing pipeline to be more robust to extract patient information from any type of clinical note. Implemented in Python using pandas, nltk, scispaCy, spaCy and regular patterns. Abstracted parts of the pipeline to be able to generalize on any type of clinical note. Reduced encoding module codebase size by over 50% while maintaining or increasing pipeline accuracy. Introduced algorithms to autocorrect optical character recognition errors for features of interest (FoI), increasing accuracy for an FoI by 5-10%. Added a training module to automatically find the best pipeline parameters in the training period. Achieved ~90% validation accuracy on 100 unseen clinical notes. Gave weekly presentations to medical professionals, faculty members, and data scientists to show progress on pipeline and request feedback. Was the only co-op student working under Professor Raymond Ng, Dr. Kathryn Isaac, and Dr. Zsuzsanna Hollander.
