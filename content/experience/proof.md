- Redesigned a fragile natural language processing pipeline to be more robust to extract patient information from any type of clinical note. 
- Implemented in Python using pandas, nltk, scispaCy, spaCy and regular patterns. 
- Abstracted parts of the pipeline, reducing encoding module codebase size by over 50% while increasing pipeline accuracy. 
- Introduced algorithms to autocorrect optical character recognition errors for features of interest (FoI), increasing accuracy for an FoI by 5-10%. 
- Achieved ~90% validation accuracy on 100 unseen clinical notes. 
- Gave weekly presentations to medical professionals, faculty members, and data scientists to show progress on pipeline and request feedback. Was the only co-op student working under Professor Raymond Ng, Dr. Kathryn Isaac, and Dr. Zsuzsanna Hollander.
