## Other Experience
I used to be involved (and still am right now) with organizing hackathons and speaking at them. 

I don't really like hackathons anymore (in fact I hate them). While I'm still involved in nwPlus, I'm staying because I made a commitment when I first joined, and I don't back out on commitments (rarely). Read [here](/blog/hackathons) on why I hate hackathons. If you want to see my involvement in hackathons, check out my LinkedIn.

I spoke at hackathons because I was excited to teach an audience about a subject, or to talk about my thoughts in CS and STEM. I don't know if I will continue to speak at hackathons, because many hackathons don't align with my values anymore. I think some hackthons are more leaned towards learning, instead of solving a problem, but I still don't like the JavaScript and general bad code encouraged at a hackathon. I may do 1:1 mentoring or coffee chats instead. If any of my workshop/panel topics interest you, please feel free to reach out by email, LinkedIn or Twitter.
