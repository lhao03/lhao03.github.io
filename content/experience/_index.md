## Other Experience
I used to be involved with organizing hackathons and speaking at them. Unfortunately, I don't vibe with hackathons anymore. When I was in my first year of university, everyone around me (computer science students) was buzzing about hackathons, so I thought I had to attend and like hackathons. 

However, the environment and atmosphere of hackathons were soon unappealing to me. Move fast and break things. Sit for 8 hours and eat junk food. Kiss up to companies. Hack together a prototype. These mantras were all against who I was: I liked to sit and think and stare, eat vegetables and move around, do projects slowly and little by little, and I never cared about working for a company before attending a hackathon. 

So why keep going to hackathons and organizing them if hackathons didn't align with my work style, thought processes, and life goals? You can learn more about my dislike of hackathons [here](/blog/hackathons). If you want to see my involvement in hackathons, check out my LinkedIn.

I don't know if I will continue to speak at hackathons because many hackathons don't align with my values anymore, so it wouldn't make sense for me to be active in hackathons, even as an external speaker. I may do 1:1 mentoring or coffee chats instead. If any of my workshop/panel topics interest you, please reach out by email, LinkedIn, or Twitter.
