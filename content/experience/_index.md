## Other Experience
I used to be involved (and still am right now) with organizing hackathons and speaking at them. 

I don't like hackathons anymore. When I was in my first year of university, everyone around me was buzzing about hackathons, so I thought I also needed to attend them and like them. Later as I saw the "CS Culture" around me, I started to dislike them. Hackathons are "move fast and break things" but I like to sit and think and stare. Hackathons are "sit abd eat junk food" but I like to eat vegetables and move around. Hackathons are "hacking together a prototype" but I like to do projects slowly and little by little. So why keep going to hackathons and organizing them if hackathons didn't align with my work style and thought process? Read [here](/blog/hackathons) on why I hate hackathons. If you want to see my involvement in hackathons, check out my LinkedIn.

While I'm still involved in nwPlus, I'm staying because I made a commitment when I first joined, and I don't back out on commitments (rarely). I'm leaving after the last hackathon, and will finally be done with hackathons.

I spoke at hackathons because I was excited to teach an audience about a subject, or to talk about my thoughts in CS and STEM. I loved tutoring my friends in chemistry in high school and tutored for volunteer hours. So I wanted to extend my tutoring/teaching into CS. I eventually was able to TA in my computer science classes! I don't know if I will continue to speak at hackathons, because many hackathons don't align with my values anymore; I still don't like the JavaScript and general bad code encouraged at a hackathon. I may do 1:1 mentoring or coffee chats instead. If any of my workshop/panel topics interest you, please feel free to reach out by email, LinkedIn or Twitter.
