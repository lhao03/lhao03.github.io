## Other Experience
I would like to preface that I don't really like hackathons anymore (in fact I hate them). While I'm involved in these organizations for hackathons, I'm staying because I made a commitment when I was younger and more naive (like 1 year ago) and I don't back out on commitments (rarely). Read [here](/blog/hackathons) on why I hate hackathons.
