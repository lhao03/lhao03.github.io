## Other Experience
I used to be involved with organizing hackathons and speaking at them. With that being said, I don't like hackathons anymore. When I was in my first year of university, everyone around me (computer science students) was buzzing about hackathons, so I thought I also needed to attend them and like them. Later as I saw the "CS Culture" around me, I started to dislike them. I feel like hackathons were: "move fast and break things", "sit and eat junk food", "kiss up to companies", "hacking together a prototype". But I like to sit and think and stare, eat vegetables and move around, do projects slowly and little by little, and I have never cared about working for a company before attending a hackathon. So why keep going to hackathons and organizing them if hackathons didn't align with my work style, thought processes and life goals? You can learn more about my dislike of hackathons [here](/blog/hackathons). If you want to see my involvement in hackathons, check out my LinkedIn.

I spoke at hackathons because I was excited to teach an audience about a subject, or to talk about my thoughts in CS and STEM. I loved tutoring my friends in chemistry in high school and tutored for volunteer hours. So I wanted to extend my tutoring/teaching into CS. I eventually was able to TA in my computer science classes! I don't know if I will continue to speak at hackathons, because many hackathons don't align with my values anymore; I still don't like the JavaScript and general bad code encouraged at a hackathon. I may do 1:1 mentoring or coffee chats instead. If any of my workshop/panel topics interest you, please feel free to reach out by email, LinkedIn or Twitter.
