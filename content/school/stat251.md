*Difficulty Rating:* 5/10

There's not much to say about this course. It's a pretty standard statistics course that teaches you about all the different types of distributions, conditional probability, and more. Make sure you're caught up on the textbook readings and questions and you won't have too much trouble with this course.

*Would I recommend?* Meh

*What I like about the course:* This is pretty standard statistics that you can find in an IB textbook, so I think you could also teach yourself this content.
