Easy booster but if you don't enjoy memorizing sentence after sentence after sentence, then this course will be a bore for you. I hated this course so much by the end. The easy booster mark was not worth the boredom and money.

*Difficult Rating:* 1/10

*Would I recommend?* No :(

*Why I regret taking this course:* If you love going hiking, skiing, etc, this course may be for you. Unfortunately for me, I do none of those activities, so I've forgotten all the content from this course. Additionally, I don't do well with memorization heavy courses. This course being distance learning made it much worse.
