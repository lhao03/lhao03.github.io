# What to Expect
This is one of those courses where you will probably like a lot, or not like much at all. Most CS majors try to postpone this course until the last year of their degree, but I personally was excited for this course. You see, I'm interested in systems programming, so this course was a lot easier and interesting for me than CPSC 320. 

That being said, there are some aspects of the course I don't like. For one, the quizzes, throw in random C questions. For someone who doesn't do a lot of C in their free time, these questions can be quite the curveball. Another are the inclass exercises. I understand that practice makes perfect; you'll see me churning out a lot of practice problems. But trying to fit a 15 minute inclass exercise into a 50 minute lecture is a time crunch. Majority of the time, we either have the lecture material fill up the entire lecture time with no time to do the inclass, or we rush through lecture material to get to the inclass exercise (but then I don't know how to do the exercises because we rushed through the lecture!). 

Another component of the course I don't understand is the tutorial. The tutorial involves some pretty bored TAs going over the question solutions at rapid speed. During the tutorial there are also live code interviews occurring in which you get called and you co over your lab code with a TA. This concept exists in CPSC 110 as well, but it is much better executed. In CPSC 110, you get asked about your problem set code from last week. In CPSC 313, I got asked about my assembly code from 3 weeks ago. I don't know about you but it's not very nice to have to try to understand and explain assembly you wrote three weeks ago. Overall, I think tutorial is very unneeded, because we already have preclass exercises, inclass exercises, labs and quizzes.
