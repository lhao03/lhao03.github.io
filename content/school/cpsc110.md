At UBC, this is one of the first computer science courses you need to take to be admitted into the computer science program, regardless of faculty. I think it is one of the hardest and most eye-opening computer science courses I've ever taken. Firstly, the course uses Racket, a programming language based on Scheme, that most people have never heard of before. (This is a good thing about the course - you're not at a disadvantage if you have never programmed before. Then you're taught to use design recipes. Sticking to a general template helps out with planning out solutions to those infamous Leetcode problems! And then finally, you must trust the natural recursion. Having learned about recursion in my first year made implementing recursion in CPSC 221 a breeze! And of course, Gregor makes sure you eat, sleep, and breathe recursion üêÑ.

*Would I recommend?* Yes!

*What I love about the course:* Gregor makes you focus on problem-solving rather than learning a specific programming language.
