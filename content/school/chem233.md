Since I'm not a chemistry major ðŸ˜­, this was the only organic chemistry course I was able to register for. I attended Jay's lectures, even though I wasn't registered for his class. Sadly, Jay will not be able to make any more T***p jokes. Lots and lots and lots of reaction pathways. Cheatsheets are your friend in this course. Also don't rely on your cheatsheets, they should only be used to confirm what you know. You should have nearly all the reaction pathways memorized. (I'm not sure if you will be allowed cheatsheets in person, so just memorize the pathways). But note that you can't just memorize the pathways, as you might need to use a combination of pathways to reach an end product. You should view these problems like puzzles and the general pathways as puzzle pieces. Make sure to stay on top of problem sets and attend office hours.

*Would I recommend?* Yes! But only if you really really like organic chemistry.

*What I love about the course:* It's all about organic chemistry!
