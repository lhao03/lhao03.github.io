# What to expect: 
I think there were weekly quizzes. I did this course remotely in the summer term, and found it pretty manageable. 

# Overall thoughts: 
If you have taken chemistry IB HL, this course will be a breeze for you. I took this course during the summer of COVID 19, so it was all online. This course comes with a VERY USEFUL course notebook. I still use that course notebook in my other chemistry and biology courses. It goes over a wide range of topics from thermodynamics, acid and base chemistry, and of course organic chemistry. It gives a nice review for those who took IBHL chemistry.
