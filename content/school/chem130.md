If you have taken chemistry IB HL, this course will be a breeze for you. I took this course during the summer of COVID 19, so it was all online. This course comes with a VERY USEFUL course notebook. I still use that course notebook in my other chemistry and biology courses.

*Would I recommend?* Yes!

*What I love about the course:* It goes over a wide range of topics from thermodynamics, acid and base chemistry, and of course organic chemistry. It gives a nice review for those who took IBHL chemistry.
