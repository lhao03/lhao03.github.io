This course is pretty much your standard data structures and algorithms courses. As someone who is not very good with this stuff, I found this course difficult at times (not to mention, it's taught in C++). And always remember to deallocate your pointers when you are done using them. Wait, what's a pointer again...

*Would I recommend?* Yes!

*What I love about the course:* Understanding data structures and algorithms is not essential to writing code, but it is essential to writing good code, especially if you decide to dive into lower-level computer stuff (it's also pretty important information for those technical interviews). So make sure you pay attention in this course!
