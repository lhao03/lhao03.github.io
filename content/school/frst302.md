# Ch 9: Evolutionary Genetics

Not until Devonian Period or Carboniferous Period → gymnosperms evolve and first forest trees were present on earth

Fundamental Tenets of the science of genetics: Darwin’s theory of evolution and Mendel’s laws of inheritance

Primary evolutionary forces: mutation, selection, migration, genetic drift 

This chapter is to understand:

1. processed of speciation and hybridization
2. taxonomic and phylogenetic relationships among species
3. molecular mechanisms by which genomes evolve
4. mutualism between species can influence evolution in both

### Divergence, Speciation, Hybridization

General classification of forests around the world:

1. tropical lowland forests
2. tropical monsoon, savanna and dry forests
3. subtropical and temperate-latitude forests
4. northern-climate coniferous forests 

**Species diversity**: within any classification unit further describes a forest type

- measured in terms of number of different species (species richness) or by proportions of different species (species evenness)
- diversity within forest types if highest in equatorial and tropical regions and decreases towards the poles
- more angiosperm than gymnosperm

### Species Concepts

- biological species concept (BSC): species is defined as a collection of individuals that interbreed and produce viable and fertile offspring, but cannot breed with members of another species
- plants: can’t move, so can’t freely mate with one another → separation can cause large morphological differences, but when brought into contact, they will breed
- many exceptions in BSC in plants so:
    - mate recognition concept: the ability to mate → even if physical isolation prevents breeding, can produce hybrids
    - morphospecies concept: species unique and heritable phenotypic characteristics → include species that reproduce asexually (don’t fit under BSC)
    - evolutionary species concept: species based on derivation from a single evolutionary lineage
    - phylogenetic species concept: emphasizes fixed character states → may overestimate the number of species

### Mechanisms of Speciation

- new species are formed from genetic differentiation and acquisition of reproductive isolation
- natural selection + genetic drift → divergence
- gene flow → retard divergence

**Allopatric Speciation**

- gradual speciation
- occurs over long period of evolutionary time
- dependent largely on forces of natural selection to produce new species from existing species
- physically separated and their ranges do not overlap
- three major phases:
    1. subpopulation becomes spatially separated from the main population → geographical events
    2. subpopulation becomes genetically differentiated from main population by genetic drift and natural selection → barriers between subpop and main pop prevent gene flow
    3. differentiation results in reproductive isolation → impossible for sub and main to interbreed

**Sympatric Speciation**

- abrupt speciation
- relatively short time period
- major genetic change that causes reproductive isolation of some members of pop from main pop
- have overlapping ranges
- types of major genetic changes:
    - single gene mutation: monogenic speciation
    - doubling or loss of entire chromosome: aneuploidy
    - multiplication of entire genomes: polyploidy
- polyploidy: responsible for abrupt speciation in higher plants and common among angiosperm forest tree taxa but rare in gymnosperm forest trees
- peripatric speciation: genetic drift in small geographically peripheral subpop causes major genetic modifications in its gene pool and subsequent development of reproductive isolation from the main body of the species → common more in trees because of their potential for long-distance seed dispersal → formation of small founder populations at the margins of a species range

### Hybridization and Introgression

- hybridization: crossing between individuals belonging to separate populations which have different adaptive norms
- mating between different species, subspecies, ecotypes, populations within a species
- mechanism for reversal of evolutionary divergence between species, but can also lead to new species creation → reticulate evolution
- interspecific F_1 hybrid results from mating of two distinct species → usually not fertile and is dead end
- hybrid swarm: population that includes pure parental species and and hybrids of varying degrees
- introgressive hybridization/introgression: repeated backcrossing of hybrids with a parental species results in the transfer of genes from one parental species to another

### Evolutionary History and Phylogeny

events that led to first multicellular, photosynthetic organisms: 

1. development of photosynthetic cells
2. development of organelles
3. development of multicellular structure
4. transition of terrestrial habit
5. development of vascular tissues
6. development of seeds
7. development of flowers

**Evolutionary History**

- gymnosperms dominated early terrestrial forests
- first angiosperms did not evolve until late Cretaceous
- conifers dominant flora during Mesozoic Era and greatest diversity of coniferous species existed at this time
- modern families of conifers evolved from Lebachiaceae found during late Paleozoic via Voltzlaceae that were found during the Mesozoic.
- majority of forest tree species, primarily angiosperms, evolved in last 130 million years
- Paleocene and Eocene epochs were hot and moist, favoring development of angiosperms

**Phylogenetics**

- phylogeny: classification of a set of taxa based on their evolutionary history
- traits must be measured on all the taxonomic units before a phylogenetic tree can be constructed
    - characters and observed values of the characters are called character states
    - measurements are made on all members of the study group (ingroup) and on one or more two related taxa that are not part of the ingroup, which are called outgroup
    - inclusion of outgroup → allows of the phylogenetic tree to be rooted → rooting allows showing the direction of the evolutionary change
    - phylogenetic trees based on different characters can produce different sets of relationships → might happen because of homoplasy → appearance of similar character states in unrelated organisms
- group individuals consisting of an ancestor and all of its descendants → monophyletic group
- group consisting of two or more related groups (result of homoplasy) → polyphyletic group
- clade: branch of phylogenetic group that includes a monophyletic group of taxa descending from a single common ancestor
- methods for constructing phylogenetic trees:
    - maximum parsimony: identify the tree requiring the fewest number changes in character states → morphological data
    - minimum distance method →molecular data
    - maximum-likelihood method → molecule data
- choice of genome (chloroplast, mitochondrial, nuclear) dependent on the level of taxonomic classification desired
    - chloroplast: evolves more slowly → best for higher-level discrimination
    - mitochondrial:
    - nuclear: evolve more rapidly, best suited for species level and lower discrimination

### Molecular Mechanisms of Genome Evolution

**Mutation and Nucleotide Diversity**

- substitutions: transitions or transversions
    - synonymous (last latter of the amino acid changes)
    - nonsynonymous (changes to an entire new base)
- nucleotide diversity: a measure of the amount of DNA sequence polymorphism in a sample of individuals taken from a population and is a function of the mutation rate
    

φ = 4N<sub>e</sub>μ where N<sub>e</sub> is effective population size and φ = p<sub>s</sub>/α1, where p<sub>s</sub> = S/n (S = number of segregating nucleotide sites and n = total number of nucleotides) α1 = 1 + 2<sup>-1</sup> +3<sup>-1</sup> …..+ (m + 1)<sup>-1</sup> and (m = number of sequences)

    
- estimate of nucleotide diversity is independent of sample size

**Gene Duplication and Gene Families** 

- another way they evolve is gene duplication
- primitive species: the only copy of gene that codes for single protein that is used throughout the developmental life of an individual
- highly evolved species: multiple copies of that same gene that arose by duplication and mutated over evolutionary time that are slightly different in their function depending on the developmental state of the organism
- ancestral species may have single copy of gene A
    - following speciation: S1 → A, S2 → A’
        - these are orthologs because they are related by descent
        - A and A’ undergo duplication to form B and B’
            - these are paralogs, because they are not directly related by descent
- phylogenies need to be based on orthologs, using paralogs is too much error prone
- conifers have many pseudogenes → nonfunctional copies of duplicated genes
- gene duplication is frequent in the evolution of forest tree genomes

P**olyploidy**

- duplication of deletion of entire chromosomes (aneuploids) or entire genomes
(polyploid) are found throughout higher plant taxa and is important evolutionary mechanism
- two types of polyploidy:
    - autopolyploidy: duplication of genomes derived from same parental species
    - allopolyploidy: duplication of genomes derived from different parental species through hybridization
- polyploidy is rare in conifers but rather common in some groups of angiosperm forest tree

### Coevolution

mutualism → two species each benefit from a biological interaction between species 

- if the mutualism directly affect the evolution of the respective species, these sp3ecies may evolve together
- coevolution: reciprocal genetic change in interacting species owing to natural selection imposed by each on the other

**Pines and Rust Fungi**

- classical theory: rust and their plant hosts have coevolved
    - primitive rusts are associated with more primitive plants and likewise for moe advanced types
- but primitive rusts can occur on more recently evolved angiosperms and more advanced rusts can occur on conifers and ferns that evolved much earlier

**White Pines and Corvids**

- pine seeds are winged and dispersed by wind
- 20 pine species don’t have wings but are a source of food for corvid birds
- only a portion of cached seeds are eventually eaten, birds affect dispersal and establishment of seedlings into new areas
    - birds have special beaks for breaking seeds and sublingual pouch

### Conclusion

- Classic definition of a species → biological species concept (BSC): collection individuals that interbreed and produce viable and fertile offspring,
but cannot breed with members of another species.
- in gymnosperm and angiosperm: BSC is not completely applicable since many species hybridize.
- Allopatric speciation →  form of gradual speciation where subpopulations become physically separated and diverge due to genetic drift and natural selection.
- Sympatric speciation → form of abrupt speciation → type of major genetic change causes some members of a population to become reproductively isolated from the rest of the population.
- Hybridization → crossing between individuals belonging to separate populations →  can reverse the process of speciation, but it can also lead to the formation of new species.
- Introgression → repeated backcrossing between the hybrids and parental species results in the transfer of genes between parental species.
- Trees first evolved 300-400 million years ago during the Devonian Period or Carboniferous Periods. Conifers dominated forests during the Mesozoic Era and angiosperms did not appear until the late Cretaceous Period. Pines probably first appeared during the Cretaceous as well.
- Phylogeny: classification of a set of taxa based on their evolutionary history.
- Phylogenies are based on measures of characters such as morphological traits and DNA sequences.
- Coevolution: reciprocal genetic change in interacting species owing to natural selection imposed by each on the other.
