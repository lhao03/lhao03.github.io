# Overall thoughts:
I have strong words to say about this course. The content is really interesting for sure, but the way this course was delivered during the pandemic made it hard for me to learn the content.

Some people think prerecorded lectures are the holy grail. Unfortunately, prerecorded lectures take forever for me to watch. A one-hour recorded lecture always turns into a three-hour lecture. Additionally, we were given 20-page readings per week and we had 6ish quizzes making up our entire mark (which I failed at least one). The quiz and final questions were ambiguous and very unforgiving. This course was essentially converted into distance learning, which I've had a horrible experience with in the past.

There is no engagement with the professor and lots and lots of memorization of content.
