This course is the second required course you need must take to apply to the computer science major at UBC. At its core, CPSC 121 is an introductory proof and logic course with circuits thrown in for good measure. Most high school students have never been exposed to the content in CPSC 121 - in CPSC 121 you must think about the why vs. the how. I usually never use office hours, but for this course I did! The assignments can be challenging, but it also feels really good to churn out a proof by induction. My advice is to keep on top of your textbook readings and use those office hours!

*Would I recommend?* Yes!

*What I love about the course:* Learning about proofs, logic and circuits can throw you into a new way of thinking that is typically not taught in high school, which is important for computer science.
