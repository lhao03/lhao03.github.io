This course helped me appreciate the biology of our body! My instructor, Vivienne, made the course engaging and taught the content in a fun and effective way. She also let us stamp and draw all over her zoom slides. Despite the course being all online, Vivienne made sure that we had many chances to engage with herself and the other students. Also, the course content is super interesting and helped me reinforce concepts I learned in MICB 202. Exams are mostly long answers based on data such as microscope images and experiments like DNA electrophoresis and SDS-PAGE.

*Would I recommend?* Yes!

*What I love about the course:* The course gets deep into what's happening inside of our cells. Here's a funny video: https://youtu.be/eEFyPbsXdN0. I promise it's worth it!
