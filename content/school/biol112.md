I took this introductory biology course in the summer of COVID 19, so it was all online. Having not taken Biology 30 (grade 12), I found this course pretty manageable. If you remember your grade 12 biology you will be set.

*Would I recommend?* Yes!

*What I like about the course:* Also a nice review of grade 12 biology. I don't think anything new was introduced though.
