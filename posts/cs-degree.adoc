_Update: 2022-5-16_

_I talk about research and ideas in this blog post from a natural
sciences/mathematical point of view. I am not a researcher, so take my
ideas with a grain of salt._

The natural sciences, like physics, chemistry and biology, are based on
experiments which require vocational skills. But data curation and
collection is meaningless without the theory to understand the data. If
you want to develop vaccines or drugs, you need to study chemistry and
biology. If you want to find the next smallest particle (quark anyone?)
or far away planet, you need to study physics.

If you want to do research, think beyond the scope of what is known, and
discover something new, then you need the theory, which means pursuing a
theoretical degree (or learning the theory yourself). A scientist needs
to think of ideas that don’t even exist. I believe theory allows you to
come up with ideas that are correct and novel; you can’t come up with
correct and novel ideas with just vocational skills. Thus, a scientist
has to be both correct and novel to be
successfulfootnote:[http://www.paulgraham.com/think.html[How to Think
for Yourself]].

But research has uncertain goals and uncertain rewards, which can scare
people, including the people who decide to pursue research. Some people
don’t care about being correct and novel, they might just care about
being correct. I would say being correct vs. _correct and novel_ is the
difference between a chemical engineer and a chemist:

:chem-reddit: footnote:[https://www.reddit.com/r/chemistry/comments/3gi2wl/chemical_engineering_vs_chemistry/[Chemical Engineering vs. Chemistry]]

____
The old joke is that with chemistry you learn how to make a new
molecule, but with ChemE you learn how to make 800 tons of it as cheaply
as possible{chem-reddit}.
____

Of course, I’m not saying engineers can’t have novel and correct ideas,
but you can be successful as an engineer just by being correct. If
you’re a scientist who can’t think of novel ideas, it’s hard to be
successful.

Thus, people may enjoy a certain field, but have no interest in
advancing the field and that’s totally okay. Some people just take the
elements on the periodic table for for granted; they don’t care to know
how electrons are "arranged" for each element. However, the quantum
nature of electrons is something I want to learn more about. On the
other hand, I think genetics is cool, but I have no interest in
understanding why certain alleles are closer to each other on a gene.

In the case that people just want to be correct, they may choose to do
engineering. In terms of engineering, there are a lot of engineering
disciplines to choose from, like chemical engineering, electrical
engineering, computer engineering, environmental engineering, materials
engineering, civil engineering, petroleum engineering, and many more.
Compared to a degree in sciences like chemistry or biology, engineering
degrees are more applied, and more focussed on correctness rather than
preparing to discover new ideas. A chemist could probably work as a
materials engineer, but someone with a degree in materials engineering
would be more efficient and cheaper to employ. A materials engineer will
study chemistry and physics, including topics like atomic bonding,
elctrochemistry, free energy, etc{ubc-materials-end}. But a
chemistry major and materials engineering major will study atomic bonds
differently. For instance, a materials engineer will learn that ceramics
include metallic and van der waals bonds{materials-atomic-bonding}, and
that would be the extent of a material engineer’s course material on
atomic bonding. A chemistry major would learn about _why_ certain bonds
exist between molecules in the first place in a series of courses like
"Electronic Structure of Atoms and Molecules"footnote:[https://www.chem.ubc.ca/chemistry-412-structure-atoms-and-molecules[CHEM 412]] and "Introduction to Quantum Mechanics and
Spectroscopy"footnote:[https://www.chem.ubc.ca/chemistry-312-introduction-quantum-mechanics-and-spectroscopy-15[CHEM
312]]. Engineers learn about processes to be efficient, correct and
useful to industry by producing goods.

The natural science degrees (chemistry, physics, biology, math) have
their place and the engineering degrees have their place. But what is
the computer science degree? I’ve noticed that computer science is
taught differently at universities, with the differences being quite
significant. At some universities, the computer science major is part of
the sciences, while at other universities computer science is part of
engineering. Some schools tend to teach more theory, while others are
more applied. This has led me to the question, _Should the computer
science degree prepare students to conceive novel and correct ideas or
prep them with the processes they need in a technology industry?_.
Well, let’s look at a few universities computer science curriculums.

== The Computer Science Degree: An impromptu and informal analysis

UBC, USC, UofT and NU all offer the computer science degree as a
bachelor in science. However,

* at UBC (University of British Columbia), computer science is under the
Faculty of Science
* at USC (University of Southern California), computer science is under
the Viterbi School of Engineering
* at UofT (University of Toronto), computer science is under the Faculty
of Arts and Science (for the St. George Campus at least)
* at NU (Northeastern University), computer science is under the Khoury
College of Computer Sciences

*Comparison of Core Computer Science Courses Required for the Degree* I
try to match the UBC version to other schools’ version.

After I compared computer science course offerings{ubc-courses},{usc-courses},{uoft-courses},footnote:nu-cs[https://catalog.northeastern.edu/undergraduate/computer-information-science/computer-science/bscs/#programrequirementstext[NU CS Curriculum]] and computer science core curriculums, here are some things that jump out to me:

NOTE: _These thoughts are based on my experiences at UBC and any course information I could find online. I was able to easily find many course websites (which included a detailed syllabus, assignments, slides and labs) from USC and NU. I couldn’t find many course websites for UofT. So take these thoughts with a grain of salt._

[[UBC-CS,UBC CS Curriculum]]
==== UBCfootnote:[https://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=12,215,410,421[UBC CS Curriculum]]:

* introductory computer science course is taught in functional paradigm
* there is a large focus on _functional programming_ which is regarded
as more "theoretical" due to its mathematical nature
** the result of a larger focus on functional programming means students
engage more with concepts like recursion
* _students are introduced to pointers and memory management in the
second year, later than other universities_
* students must learn a lot more programming languages including BSL
(dialect of Racket), Java, C, C++, etc.
* UBC has recently released a industry focussed course called "Applied
Industry Practices"", though it’s only offered in the summer
** thus UBC does not have as many industry/skills type of courses as
other universities
* compilers course is based on functional paradigm (Racket)footnote:411[https://www.students.cs.ubc.ca/~cs-411/2020w2/[CPSC 411]]

[[UofT-CS,UofT CS Curriculum]]
==== UofTfootnote:[https://artsci.calendar.utoronto.ca/section/Computer-Science#programs[UofT CS Curriculum]]:

* uses Python as first programming language
* no need for students to take explicit software engineering course if
they have done co-op. They can also choose out of a list of courses
(meaning they don’t need to do a software engineering course)
* courses tend to use Python and C for systems courses, and Java for OOP
course
* as a result of programming language choices, courses are _more OOP and
imperative based_
* has more industry type of courses like "Programming on the Web",
"Natural Language Computing", "High-Performance Scientific Computing"
* _students are introduced to OOP first and imperative programming first
(no recursion, pointers or memory management like UBC and USC)_
* compilers course is based on imperative paradigm (Using
Python???)footnote:488[https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~pdm/csc488/winter2019/assignments/a3.html[CSC488]]

[[USC-CS, USC CS Curriculum]]
==== USCfootnote:[https://www.cs.usc.edu/academic-programs/undergrad/computer-science/[USC CS Curriculum]]:

* uses C++ as first programming language
* courses seem more continuous, with 103L following right off from the
end of 102L.
** probably because C++ is used, and C++ fits nicely with the operating
systems course, data structures, and algorithms course
** only other language used is Java for OOP
* required to take ENGR 102, the engineering freshman academy
* required to take Introductions to AI and Internetworking
* choice of choosing a capstone course of either "Design and
Construction of Large Software Systems" or "Creating Your High-Tech Startup"
* required to take an embedded systems course
* has many "skills" focussed courses like "Professional C++",
"Native Console Multiplayer Game Development", "Programming Graphical
User Interfaces"
* also has more industry type of courses like "Creating Your High-Tech Startup"
* _students are introduced to pointers and memory management in their
first year, while they are introduced to recursion/functional
programming in their second/third year_

[[NU-CS, NU CS Curriculum]]
==== Northeasternfootnote:nu-cs[]

* first year computer science course is similar to UBC’s
* two fundamentals courses (2500 and 2510), whereas UBC only has one
(CPSC 110), before the OOP course
* students are required to do a security course
* there are both theoretical and proof based courses like computer-aided
reasoning, verification, synthesis. I haven’t seen other universities
have these type of courses at the undergrad level
* there are also very industry and skills focussed courses like mobile
development and web development.
* there are several concentrations a student can choose to do, including
concentrations that are more theoretical and concentrations that are
very industry focussed.
* only one low level course required
* a theory of computation course is required
* there is also a statistics/mathematics course that is tailored for the
computer science major: "Studies the methods and ideas in linear
algebra, multivariable calculus, and statistics that are most relevant
for the practicing computer scientist doing machine learning, modeling,
or hypothesis testing with data"
* students learn about Turing machines, Church-Turing thesis, automata
as part of their version of CPSC 320. Students at UBC can also learn
about the mentioned concepts but in another course (so it’s optional)
* there is a strong theory base for computer science degrees, but after
that your degree can be very theoretical or industry/skills focussed

In Canada, computer science seems to be treated closer to science,
meaning students don’t take many computer engineer-like courses. In the
USA, computer science seems to be treated more as engineering, meaning
students usually take a few low level hardware/systems courses that
electrical and computer engineers take.

The core curriculums are pretty similar in regards to courses in
operating systems, systems programming/computer systems/computer
organization. I’m guessing this is because many universities will teach
students about the Linux operating system. This is probably because
Linux is open sourced so it’s easier for professors and students to
access (they can access Linux through university servers), and how
there’s basically only two operating systems Linux (Unix/MacOS) and
Windows. Of course there are differences between Linux and MacOS, but
the general categories of operating systems will be Unix and Windows.
Additionally, since most systems programming has been done in C, 99% of
the time C is the language of choice for these courses.

For data structure and algorithm courses: At UBC, C++ is used for CPSC
221. USC also uses C++ for CSCI 104L. At UofT, I can’t seem to find what
CSC263H1 is taught in, so I will assume no programming language is used,
thought I may be completely wrong on this. NU also doesn’t seem to use a
programming language in their data structures and algorithms course.
Other then that, the data structures and algorithms course is pretty
similar in content between schools.

What differs the most are the introductory computer science courses, and
they differ drastically.
UBCfootnote:[http://cs110.students.cs.ubc.ca/syllabus.html[CPSC110]] and
NU’sfootnote:[https://felleisen.org/matthias/Thoughts/Developing_Developers.html[Developing
Developers]] introductory computer science course follows the HtDP
curriculum (that teaches a functional programming paradigm) using
teaching languages like BSL.
USCfootnote:[https://ee.usc.edu/~redekopp/cs102/Fa21Syllabus.pdf[CS102]]
uses C++ and teaches low-level concepts and imperative programming.
UofTfootnote:[https://www.cs.toronto.edu/dcs/ugdocs/course-outlines/2021/Fall/CSC108H1-Fall2021.pdf[CSCI108]]
follows the book "Practical Programming (3rd ed): An Introduction to
Computer Science Using Python 3" using Python to teach a bit of OOP but
not really anything about pointers or functional programming(?).

Additionally, some schools like UofT, USC and NU offer "pathways"
which list suggested/required courses a student should take. For
instance, there are specializations like "HCI", "Systems",
"Foundations", etc. UBC doesn’t have something like this, but students
could form their own pathway (it’s just not as explicit). These pathways
allow students to choose if they want their degree to be more theory
based or skills based.

== The Different Types of Schools

There’s a school of thought that functions are either pointers or
values. A C programmer would say "well functions are simply pointers in
memory". A Racket or ML programmer would say "well we treat functions
just like data, so they are values". What about the Java or Python
programmer? Well, I’m not sure. An introductory computer science course
usually falls within one (or neither) of these schools.

++++

I think the introductory computer science course, and higher year
courses a university offers, greatly influence a student’s degree, and
their perception of computer science. Based on how a university conducts
their introductory computer science course and the upper year offerings,
I’ve come up with three types of schools.

=== The Engineering (Pointer) School

Schools in the USA that classify computer science under engineering such
as USC fall into this category. The computer science degree will be
similar to the computer engineering degree in the first year, with
students learning C++ and some hardware-focussed courses like embedded
systems.

The Pointer school then uses C++ for majority of the computer science
courses, including the introductory computer science course. This means
students learn about pointers and memory management very early on in
their computer science degrees. Theoretical concepts are covered in
later years of the degree.

Thus, the course is modeled around the programming language, rather than
the programming language being modeled around the concepts. As an
example, in the first computer science course at USC, students must
learn data representation of integers and strings before they can use
them in C++; this is because C++ is a low-level language. Concepts are
more concrete rather than abstract, like learning about "passing
arrays". Someone learning functional programming doesn’t need to know
how integers and arrays are stored in memory or whether they should use
`u16` or `u32` in order to use an integer or array.

Engineering schools can also be industry schools because higher level
courses will offer more industry skills and focus on teaching
"fashionable programming languages and currently popular programming
paradigms"footnote:cs-does-not-matter[https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/fk-why-cs-doesnt-matter/paper.pdf[Viewpoint: Why Computer Science Doesn’t Matter]].

=== The Functional Programming (Theory) School

Schools like UBC or NU fall into this category, and teach the
introductory computer science course based on a systematic approach
(Structure and Interpretation of Programs/HtDP, UBC and NU both using HtDP)footnote:htdp[http://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/fffk-htdp-vs-sicp-journal/[HtDP vs. SICP]] using an
educational programming language in the functional programming paradigm.
This systematic approach stresses "explicit and systematic approaches
to program
design"footnote:[https://felleisen.org/matthias/Thoughts/Developing_Developers.html[Developing
Developers]], rather than worrying about number representation, pointers
and memory management that pointer/engineering schools would focus on. A
functional programming paradigm is usually used because it’s easier to
reason about: no mutation, data and state are separate, and it looks
similar to algebra (given an input, you get an output). There is a large
emphasis on forming well designed and correct programs and using
concepts like recursion which can be easily proved correct through
induction. Whereas to prove a `for loop` is correct you require more
steps. Many more theoretical concepts are covered, due to the simple
nature of the high level educational language, which allows students to
focus more on learning and practicing abstract or theoretical concepts
like recursion and higher order functions. In general, there is a focus
on aligning programming with mathematics, for instance by the
"composition of functions and expressions"footnote:cs-does-not-matter[].

In regards to upper year offerings, NU has course offerings in
Computer-Aided Reasoning, Complexity Theory, and System Specification,
Verification, and Synthesis (to name a few). These types of courses are
more of the "formal" and "mathematical" nature, and rarely offered
to undergrads at other universities, including UBC! Even similar courses
can differ at a theory school. At UBC, the compiler course is taught in
Racket and centers around creating a compiler for a functional language,
whereas at UofT, the compiler course is taught in Python and focusses on
creating a compiler for an imperative language.

A theory school provides you a stronger theory background, which is good
if you will plan to go into grad school or research.

=== The Java or Python (Industry) School

I first learned about the concept when reading a paperfootnote:principles-2-practice[Tobin-Hochstadt, S., & Van Horn, D. (2013). From Principles to Practice with Class in the First Year. Electronic Proceedings in Theoretical Computer Science, 136, 1–15. doi:10.4204/eptcs.136.1]
about using teaching languages to introduce objects and
eventually OOP. While reading the references, I was intrigued by a blog
post called "The Perils of
JavaSchools"footnote:[https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2005/12/29/the-perils-of-javaschools-2/[The
Perils of JavaSchools]], which is where I learned the concept of a
JavaSchool.

So what is a JavaSchool, or more generally an "industry" school? An
industry school is one that teaches what is currently popular in
industry, aka "teaching fashionable programming languages and currently
popular programming paradigms"footnote:cs-does-not-matter[]. For the
introductory programming course, a popular mainstream programming
language like Java or Python along with a popular programming paradigm,
such as object orientated programming is taught. Concepts like pointers
or recursion are merely brushed over, or never even mentioned until the
systems course or the algorithms course.

"You may be wondering if teaching object oriented
programming (OOP) is a good weed-out substitute for pointers and
recursion. The quick answer: no. Without debating OOP on the merits, it
is just not hard enough to weed out mediocre programmers. OOP in school
consists mostly of memorizing a bunch of vocabulary terms like
“encapsulation" and "inheritance" and taking multiple-choice
quizzicles on the difference between polymorphism and overloading. Not
much harder than memorizing famous dates and names in a history class,
OOP poses inadequate mental challenges to scare away first-year
students. When you struggle with an OOP problem, your program still
works, it’s just sort of hard to maintain. Allegedly. But when you
struggle with pointers, your program produces the line Segmentation
Fault and you have no idea what’s going on, until you stop and take a
deep breath and really try to force your mind to work at two different
levels of abstraction simultaneously."
-- Joel Spolsky, https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2005/12/29/the-perils-of-javaschools-2/[The Perils of JavaSchools]

I didn’t choose to attend UofT and UofC for computer science because
they were industry schools that taught OOP using Python in the
introductory computer science course, and many of their higher year
courses didn’t seem interesting to me. But they may seem interesting to
someone more industry orientated.

Another argument against teaching OOP in the introductory computer
science course is that the "complexity of object-orientated programming
bears little fruit"footnote:cs-does-not-matter[] for first year students.

"It makes no sense to teach students how to engineer
structure of large programs when they are yet to write any programs with
a complexity worth structuring."
-- Matthias Felleisen and Shriram Krishnamurthi, http://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/fk-why-cs-doesnt-matter/[Why Computer Science Doesn’t Matter]

Industry schools will also have upper year courses like "web
development", "mobile development", or computer science courses that
are also business oriented. USC, UofT and NU have courses like this.

With that being said, industry schools prepare you to with skills to
write software for the industry.

=== Why make the distinction between "Pointer" and "Industry" School?

Computer engineering and computer science are frequently confused. Is
the operating system more part of computer science or web development?
Should computer science students learn how to interact with memory if
they probably won’t be writing code that uses Linux system calls?

Computer engineering is more associated with how a computer works, down
to the circuits and metal bits, in addition to assembly and C. Pointer
schools which classify computer science as part of engineering likely
have more low-level courses and an emphasis on low-level concepts.

On the other hand, an industry school sees computer science more for
being software that has been created with high-level languages like
Java. Thus, industry schools won’t focus on low-level concepts that
much, because popular languages like Java, Python and JavaScript have
abstracted away the details of memory.

_This is how I would categorise the four schools I analyzed_ 

image::/images/cs-degree/schoolRadarChart.png[]

== Are Computer Science Degrees too Theoretical?

Time and time again I hear people complain that computer science degrees
are useless. This probably occurs more at UBC than other schools because
there aren’t many courses that contain "industry skills" like web
development. The only course that teaches web development technologies
at UBC (CPSC
455)footnote:[https://courses.students.ubc.ca/cs/courseschedule?sesscd=S&campuscd=UBC&pname=subjarea&tname=subj-section&sessyr=2022&course=455&section=901&dept=CPSC[CPSC
455]] is only offered in the summer. UBC has many higher level theory
based courses, like Definition of Programming Languages (taught in
Racket), Introduction to Compiler Construction (which is applied because
there’s a project, but taught in (a functional paradigm) Racket, which
students may feel is more "theoretical" than say using Python like
UofT does), Numerical Linear Algebra, Computational Optimization and
Advanced Algorithms Design and Analysis to name a few. Besides the web
development course offer in the summer, there aren’t many courses that
directly teach "popular and hot"* industry skills at UBC.

*There are game development courses at UBC, but most computer science
students aren’t interested in game development due to the lower end
salary and grueling hours as compared to a Big Tech job.

Meanwhile, at USC, NU, and UofT there are many more courses that
directly teach industry skills. At USC, there are courses called
"Programming Graphical User Interfaces" and "Android App
Development". Similarly, UofT has "Programming on the Web",
"Designing Systems for Real World Problems", "The Business of
Software". At NU, students can choose to make their degree more
industry focussed or theory focussed, hence why NU is strong in both
theory and industry in the radar chart above.

image::/images/cs-degree/theory-vs-industry.png[]

In regards to core curriculums, NU’s is the most theory based. Students
learn about the Turing thesis for instance, which none of the other 3
universities require. Next is UBC. UBC’s focus on a functional paradigm
makes it more theory based than USC or UofT, which teach their
introductory computer science course with an low-level / OOP focus,
respectively. USC and UofT are close in terms of core curriculums, but
UofT edges USC over theory based on computer science course offerings;
UofT has more theory based higher level course offerings than USC. This
is just my observation.

Maybe you’re wondering why there’s so many differences in how
universities teach computer science. Different schools can really offer
a different computer science education to their students. Well I think
it’s because of the confusion of what computer science is.

"there is a widespread belief that computing science as
such has been all but completed and that, consequently, computing has
"matured" from a theoretical topic for the scientists to a practical
issue for the engineers, the managers and the entrepreneurs, i.e. mostly
people —and there are many of those!— who can accept the application of
science for the obvious benefits, but feel rather uncomfortable with its
creation because they don’t understand what the doing of research, with
its intangible goals and its uncertain rewards, entails."
-- Edsger W. Dijkstra, https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD13xx/EWD1304.html[The end of Computing Science]

The question we need to ask then:

*Is the computer science degree for students who wish to pursue research
in computer science to think of correct and novel ideas, or for the
student who only cares about being correct and making money in the
software industry?*

Currently, the computer science degree at many schools tries to do it
all: prepare students for grad school and prepare students to create web
applications in the software industry. I don’t think this is good
because one area severely lacking in many computer science degrees (not
in the curriculum or offered in higher level courses) is reasoning and
formal verification of systems (and security)! Dijkstra also thought the
same many years ago!

"Until the end of his life, Dijkstra maintained that
the central challenges of computing hadn’t been met to his satisfaction,
due to an insufficient emphasis on program correctness (though not
obviating other requirements, such as maintainability and efficiency)"
-- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Cruelty_of_Really_Teaching_Computer_Science[Wikipedia]

I don’t think universities are equipping computer science students to do
research in areas like formal verification, dependent types, compiler
correctness and more. I also don’t think computer science degrees are
equipping students well for the industry either. There needs to be a
different path for computer scientists and software developers, like
there is for chemists and chemical engineers. Computer science is a
different subject than software
developmentfootnote:[https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2005/01/02/advice-for-computer-science-college-students/[Advice
for Computer Science College Students]].

So is the computer science degree too theoretical? *If the computer
science degree is to prepare students to do the hard work of thinking of
correct and novel ideas in the field of computer science, then no, the
computer science degree is not too theoretical. It actually isn’t
theoretical enough.* _Of course, this means there should be a different
degree for people who want to work in the software industry._

For instance, we can all agree that software is laden with bugs and as
Dijkstra says:

"On the contrary, most of our systems are much more
complicated than can be considered healthy, and are too messy and
chaotic to be used in comfort and confidence. The average customer of
the computing industry has been served so poorly that he expects his
system to crash all the time, and we witness a massive worldwide
distribution of bug-ridden software for which we should be deeply
ashamed."

Verifying programs is hard. But everything is a program in computer
science! A compiler is a program that takes in a program and outputs
another program! It’s one thing to write a program, and another thing to
verify a program is both useful and correct.

I liken it to the production of drugs. It’s one thing to discover a
drug, and it’s another thing to synthesize that drug. Then it’s another
thing to learn how to synthesize that drug on a large scale as safely
and effectively as possible. Without someone who understands the theory,
you can’t think of a way of making a drug. For instance, an novice
chemistry student may find the formula to create a drug, and realise
they have unfortunately created stereoisomers of the drug. But only one
stereoisomer of the drug works; in most cases, the other stereoisomers
are not effective or even harmful. There are ways to filter the
products, but this means you waste around half of your products, which
is not good because many drug precursors are byproducts of the oil and
gas

so we don’t have an infinite supply. This is a hard problem in
chemistry, the solution being awarded a 2021 Nobel Prize in
Chemistryfootnote:[https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/2021/press-release[2021
Nobel Prize in Chemistry]].

For a long time, drug makers were stuck having to filter out their
products for the correct stereoisomer. After years of research, there
are now ways to conduct "asymmetric organocatalysis", meaning you only
create one stereoisomer. Similarly to program verification, we are
currently stuck writing tests. But "testing cannot prove the absence of
bugs it can prove their
existence"footnote:[https://wiki.c2.com/?TestsCantProveTheAbsenceOfBugs[Tests
Cant Prove The Absence Of Bugs]]. For now, we are just stuck writing
tests among tests and hoping for the best, like the novice chemistry
student was stuck just filtering out the products for the correct
stereoisomer.

But how can be achieve this ability to easily verify a program is
correct? How do we prove the absence of bugs so we don’t get
catastrophic scenarios like
NASAfootnote:[https://ti.arc.nasa.gov/m/pub-archive/1338h/1338%20(Brat).pdf[NASA]]
sometimes does? With research. Which requires a strong understanding of
theory. Right now, formal verification is an "unmastered complexity".
Many problems in computer science are an "unmasterd complexity".

____
You see, while we all know that unmastered complexity is at the root of
the misery, we do not know what degree of simplicity can be obtained,
nor to what extent the intrinsic complexity of the whole design has to
show up in the interfaces. We simply do not know yet the limits of
disentanglement. We do not know yet whether intrinsic intricacy can be
distinguished from accidental intricacy. We do not know yet whether
trade-offs will be possible. We do not know yet whether we can invent
for intricacy a meaningful concept about which we can prove theorems
that help. *To put it bluntly, we simply do not know yet what we should
be talking about, but that should not worry us, for it just illustrates
what was meant by "intangible goals and uncertain rewards"*.
____

So how do we figure out the "limits of disentanglement" and
"trade-offs"? By equipping students with the theory required to think
of correct and novel ideas.
