*Difficulty Rating:* 8/10

To do well in this course, either take MathHL, or self-study. I didn't put enough time into this course, and you get what you put in, so I was not expecting a good mark or anything. But there's courses in computer science, chemistry and biochemistry that need this course as a pre-req so 🤷🏻‍♀.
