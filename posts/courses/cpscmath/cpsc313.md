# What to Expect
This is one of those courses where you will probably like a lot, or not like much at all. Most CS majors try to postpone this course until the last year of their degree, but I personally was excited for this course. You see, I'm interested in systems programming, so this course was a lot easier and interesting for me than CPSC 320.
