*Difficulty Rating:* 4/10

I found this course one of the easiest computer science courses I've taken so far as a computer science student. This course is all about Java, OOP, and design patterns! This is also the first course that has a large project associated with it. The project requirements aren't that hard, but anything becomes hard if you don't have enough time to do it. This course uses the same video platform that CPSC 110 did. I liked drawing out relationships between classes, objects, and methods to understand what was going on. I'm also currently a teaching assistant for this course, so hit me up if you are in this course and need help.

*Would I recommend?* Yes.

*What I love about the course:* The content in this computer science course is super important to writing good code. Design patterns are also super cool to learn about (they are used a lot in Android development if you're interested in that.)
