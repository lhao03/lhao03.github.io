_Updated: 2022-05-23_

WARNING: I am not a aerosol researcher, or virologist. I welcome thoughts and
critique on this post. Contact me via Twitter or email.

*TL;DR*: Proximity and time based exposure notifications made sense as a way to measure exposure
risk when SARS-CoV-2 was thought to spread through respiratory droplets that quickly dropped to the
ground. This meant if you were _within two metres from an infected individual for less than 15
minutes_, or you were _farther than two metres from an infected individual_ you could assume almost
no viral load was transferred to you, and thus no exposure risk. Thus, apps measured time and
distance to determine exposure risk.

:ct-values: footnote:[https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/guidance-documents/polymerase-chain-reaction-cycle-threshold-values-testing.html[About cycle threshold (Ct) values]]

However, now we know SARS-CoV-2 is airborne and can linger in the air for minutes to hours and
travel farther than two metres. This means other factors, such as the infected’s quality of mask and
quality of air filtration, are key to determining how far the virus can travel and how long the
virus can linger in the air, which then determines the viral load{ct-values} that someone may have
been exposed to, aka exposure risk. A digital contact tracing app has no way of knowing the
contextual information about the environment someone is in, and thus does not have enough
information to determine exposure risk. This means it no longer makes sense to rely on a digital
contact tracing app.

== The original paper 
(Ferretti et al., 2020)footnote:original-paper[Ferretti, L., Wymant, C., Kendall, M., Zhao, L., Nurtay, A., Abeler-Dörner, L., Parker, M., Bonsall, D., & Christophe Fraser. (2020). Quantifying SARS-CoV-2 transmission suggests epidemic control with digital contact tracing. Science, 368(6491), eabb6936. https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abb6936]
suggested the idea of digital contact tracing via a digital contact tracing app.
These were the points made as to why a digital contact tracing app
could be a tool to reduce infections during the COVID-19 pandemic: 

* manual contact tracing is too slow to bring down the R value, but a digital contact tracing app that instantaneously notified a exposed person to isolate would bring down the R value. Digital contact tracing apps have had success in China and South Korea.

* "There is no delay between case confirmation and notification of contacts; thus, the delay for the contact quarantine process is the period from an individual experiencing symptoms to their contacts entering quarantine. The delay between symptom development and case confirmation will decrease with faster testing protocols, and indeed could become instant if presumptive diagnosis of COVID-19 based on symptoms were accepted in high-prevalence areas." (Ferretti et al., 2020)

* "If testing capacity is limited, individuals who are identified by tracing may be presumed confirmed upon onset of symptoms, because the prior probability of them being positive is higher than for the index case, accelerating the algorithm further without compromising specificity." (Ferretti et al., 2020)

* "With fast enough testing, even index cases diagnosed late in infection could be traced recursively to identify recently infected individuals, both before they develop symptoms and before they transmit." (Ferretti et al., 2020) 
** This could be done quickly with an algorithm, as opposed to manual contact tracing. 

* "Because time of infection is generally not known, the generation time is often approximated by the serial interval, which is defined as the time between the onset of symptoms of the source and the onset of symptoms of the recipient." (Ferretti et al., 2020)

* "The app can serve as the central hub of access to all COVID-19 health services, information, and instructions, and as a mechanism to request food or medicine deliveries during self-isolation." (Ferretti et al., 2020)

:canada-digital-contact-tracing-app: footnote:[https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/coronavirus-disease-covid-19/covid-alert.html[COVID Alert]]

In fact, Canada has their own digital contact tracing app{canada-digital-contact-tracing-app}.
It works as shown below:

image::/images/digital-contact-tracing/canadacovid.png[]

* When you’re near someone else with the app, both phones exchange random codes every 5 minutes. 
* The app estimates how close app users are to one another by the strength of their Bluetooth signals. 
* The random codes change often and can’t be used to identify you. 
* An exposure is recorded if you’re within 2 metres of someone with COVID-19 for 15 minutes or longer. 
* Each day, your phone gets a list of the random codes of app users who have reported a diagnosis. This is only possible when connected to the
internet. 
* If it finds a matching code on your phone, the app notifies you that you’ve been exposed. It explains what to do next.

The general idea around digital contact tracing apps is that based on some proximity and time
threshold, in Canada’s COVID-19 app this is 2 metres and 15 minutes, you will be alerted with a
notification that you were exposed to someone with COVID-19. Upon this notification, you would
quarantine to prevent infecting other people. It’s been a year since the release of Canada’s digital
tracking app, and I took a peek at the report.

Maybe you’re wondering why I’m so interested in this. Well, digital contact tracing sounded like a
super cool idea of an application of technology in public health. I was excited about the app and
downloaded it myself. Unfortunately, I’ve deleted it, and in my review of the report maybe you’ll
see why.

== My review of the "Interim report on social and economic determinants of app adoption, retention and use"

:interim-report: footnote:[https://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/icgc.nsf/eng/07716.html[Interim report on social and economic determinants of app adoption, retention and use]]

The Canadian government came out with a report{interim-report} reviewing the impact Canada’s digital
tracking app on the pandemic. My thoughts are in _in italic_. When I say "council" I am referring
to the "COVID-19 Exposure Notification App Advisory Council".

[quote, 'Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada']
____
COVID Alert has been downloaded over 6 million times, and 20,000 people
have since entered a one-time key (OTK) following a positive COVID-19
test result, notifying other users that they may have been exposed to
the virus.
____

_As of Feb 2022, there have been 6,893,423 downloads and 57,704 keys used. With a population of
around 38 million, this means only 15-20% of the population has downloaded the app. There are
apparently 3.64M tracked COVID-19 cases (all time) in Canada when I checked on Apr 18. This means
the app had access to around 1.6% of positive cases to determine if someone could have been exposed,
and then alert them. Such a low number of reported cases means this app is a inaccurate tool for
someone to use as a judgement to whether they have been exposed or not. I found all these values via
a quick Google search._

[quote, 'Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada']
____
COVID Alert is a national exposure notification app that will alert
users if they have been in close contact with other users who have
tested positive for COVID-19.
____

_Getting only reports for "close contact" gives the impression that
you can only get sick from being "close" to someone. This is
incorrect, since researchers have discovered cases in which no one was a
close contact with each other, yet still people were becoming infected.
You *can* get sick *without* being near someone who is sick._

[quote, 'Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada']
____
Although individuals experiencing these barriers are unable to use the
app directly, they can still benefit from it if other people use it. For
example, if someone with the app receives a notification, they may
decide not to visit a medically vulnerable person. This action protects
the vulnerable person from potential exposure, even if the vulnerable
person does not have their own compatible phone.
____

_Much of the app is based on voluntary action. The phrase "may decide" is used,
and this makes it seem as if vulnerable people are at the mercy of those who
have the latest technology and can use the digital contact tracing app. We
can’t assume people will act with the best intentions, and certainly cannot
just leave vulnerable folks at the hands of able-bodied and privileged people.
The report also implies that it’s okay to exclude vulnerable individuals from
this tool. Everyone deserves access to tools to protect themselves._

[quote, 'Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada']
____

Currently, British Columbia, Alberta, Nunavut and the Yukon have not
adopted the COVID Alert app.
____
_If nearly all of Western Canada isn’t able to use the app, then that’s a huge
piece of data missing._

The report outlines reasons that users uninstall the app:

* Perceives that the app is not user-friendly;
* Believes that the app will not be substantially effective without broader public uptake;
** _I believe this as well, and this statement is why I uninstalled the app.
Digital contact tracing can provide some insight if most of the population uses
it, much like in China, South Korea or Taiwan. With less than 5% of positive
cases entering a key and only 18% of the population having downloaded the app
(not sure how many actually use it), the data is just random noise._
* Does not receive any exposure notifications and therefore assumes that
the app is not performing as designed;
** _Obviously this is because there’s literally such low numbers of data being
collected, which gives people the impression that COVID-19 isn’t transmitting
around that much, which is totally incorrect. The app simply can’t reflect the
true transmission rates because not enough data is being entered._
* Lacks understanding or is confused by on how the app works (e.g., contact-based and not location-based);
* Experiences anxiety related to receiving a notification and possible
consequences (e.g., isolating, testing); or
** _if you were to receive a diagnosis, you would probably prefer a human tell
you, rather than an app. With an app, there’s no one to help you answer follow
up questions or to calm you down. This is why we need humans._
* Experiences technical issues such as battery life on some phone models.
** _Bluetooth is incredibly battery draining._

Here are some new features they’ve added:

* narrowing the exposure notification window to periods when a
COVID-positive user was the most infectious, by allowing the user to
voluntarily enter their symptom onset or test date;
** _this is horrible. There are cases when people who are asymptomatic
are infectious. Additionally, with all the COVID-19 variants, someone
becomes infectious at different rates. We can’t simplify down COVID-19
to just when we think someone is most infectious. This also seems very
hard to determine, because of how variants aren’t turning up as positive
on rapid tests and the lack of tests in the first place._
* allowing users, specifically for health care workers, to manually turn
the app off when wearing the appropriate personal protective equipment
in areas with high likelihood of being near COVID-positive persons
(e.g. test centres, long-term care facilities); and
** _this makes some sense, but the feature could be abused and up to each person to judge if they
think they are wearing appropriate personal protective equipment._
* allowing users to clear the exposed state following a negative test
result, in order to permit users to receive new exposure notifications.
** _guidance must be given on this. Since rapid tests aren’t always
accurate, someone may take a false negative as being no longer infected,
when in fact they are still contagious._

_These points oversimplify COVID-19 to simply "avoiding" someone when
they are most infectious, and encouraging people to prematurely return
back to society when they may still be infectious. Transmission can
occur when you’re not even beside an infected individual. The virus can
linger in the air. Nothing related to the "air", such as letting users know about CO2 levels or
air transmission is mentioned._

Under "Strategies to reduce barriers and increase adoption, retention and proper use of the app": 

> Establish a baseline number of app downloads that would be considered sufficient to appropriately measure
the effectiveness of the app in reducing the spread of the virus;

_The council acknowledges that WHO said in 2020 that "no established
methods for assessing the effectiveness of digital proximity tracking"
but then goes on to say that "The Scientific Director of the Big Data
Institute at the University of Oxford recently indicated that apps such
as COVID Alert are having a positive impact, even in the absence of
specific quantifying metrics and that the concept of a minimal adoption
rate is less relevant to these apps because this type of tool is
effective regardless of its level of up-take". I’m not sure if I believe this._

[quote, 'Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada']
____
The Government of Canada has begun to broadly consider how the COVID
Alert app could potentially extend beyond a government service to
Canadians and the public health system towards a tool that will also
support Canadians and businesses in our economic, social and mental
health recovery and restoration. To this end, it will be critical for
individuals and businesses in Canada to have trust in the app’s ability
to support their safe return to worksites and universities, their
reopening of businesses, and their use of modes of transportation
including public transit (air, marine, and rail services) until the
pandemic is declared over. The advice of the Council will help to inform
the Government’s next steps in all of these regards.
____

_The statement above directly contradicts with the statement that the
Canadian government will work on "eventual wind-down of the app,
including recommendations for the timely destruction of data." There is also the idea that people 
think an app will "magically" make things easier for faster._

[quote, 'Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada']
____
Position COVID Alert as one additional tool at the disposal of
Canadians, to better situate its position within the broader public
health response to the COVID-19 pandemic and to highlight success
stories that would resonate with Canadians; […] This will be critical in
achieving wider uptake, which will involve clear communications, ongoing
engagement with diverse partners and communities; and continuous
improvements to the app (e.g. new functionalities and emerging
technologies that could help to re-open parts of the economy)
____

_This frustrates me. We *have* methods that work and do reduce cases,such as high
quality masks, air filtration and increasing outdoor air supply. I’m disappointed
that none of these were mentioned. We don’t need more apps.
Instead, we need to use methods that work._

[quote, 'Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada']
____
Through the deployment of the COVID Alert app, the Government of Canada
has committed to deploying a technology-based solution that will assist
Canada in flattening the curve and limiting the spread of COVID-19.
____

_The public has to trust health experts and actively prevent infection
by getting booster shots, masking up, getting routinely tested for COVID-19, and self-isolating
until no longer infectious. Government needs to track data, such as
waste water and CO2 levels, so we can prepare for the future. We shouldn’t be
investing so much time and energy into a tool we aren’t even sure works
when we now understand that COVID-19 is airborne._

_Technology based solutions frequently simplify complex solutions into
simple models that may not be accurate. It’s been two years since the
pandemic began, and we have more knowledge of the virus. There are tools
that do work, such as CO2 monitors, which can help someone decide if
eating at a restaurant is safe or not. Digital contact tracing, at its
current state, does not provide any useful information to citizens.
There are no metrics mentioned, after more than one year of use, if this
app prevented anyone from being infected. We can’t say the app has
assisted at all in limiting spread of COVID-19 if there’s no metrics to
back that up._

The report fails to mention anything about COVID-19 being airborne and
what the app plans to change to take into account that distances more
than 2 metres may still expose someone to COVID-19.

With more variants emerging, the government has a responsibility to
update its citizens about these variants and provide data to help
citizens make informed decisions.

Our world is constantly changing, and software must adapt to these
changes, not the other way around. However, it seems today that the
world is constantly catering to the software, simplifying down complex
situations only to have the world slap us in the face later.

'''''

There are two issues that stand out to me:

* the digital contact tracing app was designed with the idea that COVID-19
transited via respiratory droplets
* more people need to download *and* use the app to make the app a useful and reliable tool

However, now that we know COVID-19 transmits through aerosols and that the
accuracy of the app depends on the numbers of people using it, here are the
questions I want to raise on why I think there’s a low chance of Canada being
able to adopt a digital contact tracing app and why I think the digital contact
tracing app is inaccurate:

* Is proximity the best measure?
* What about testing and variants?
* Adoption of the app by the public?

== Is proximity the best measure?

The paper I mentioned above also stated that:

[quote, '(Ferretti et al., 2020)']
____
By devoting considerable resources, including police investigation, 75
of the 92 cases of local transmission were traced back to their presumed
exposure, either to a known case or to a location linked to spread (15).
Linking cases via a location generally includes the possibility of
environmentally mediated transmission. Therefore, the large fraction of
traceable transmission in Singapore does not contradict the large
fraction without symptomatic exposure in Wuhan.

:who-airborne: footnote:[https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-00925-7[Why the WHO took two years to say COVID is airborne]]
It’s understandable that Western nations assumed COVID-19 wasn’t airborne, as other
deadly illnesses like cholera and polio spread through fluids and fecal
matter. Declaring a virus is airborne is also alarming, and as a global
body, WHO may have thought it was their responsibility not to
accidentally set a false alarm. However, we now know that COVID-19 is
airborne{who-airborne}.

:two-m: footnote:[Qureshi, Z., Jones, N., Temple, R., Larwood, J. P. J., Greenhalgh, T., & Bourouiba, L. (2020, June 25).

Retrieved April 18, 2022, from https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/what-is-the-evidence-to-support-the-2-metre-social-distancing-rule-to-reduce-covid-19-transmission/]
Digital contract tracing apps which use proximity to determine exposure
reduce COVID-19 transmission into the notion that we only need to be
near sick people to get sick. When not much was known about COVID-19
transmission and it was believed to transmit through respiratory
droplets that quickly fell to the ground, this would have been a model
that made sense. But with more research highlighting evidence on
COVID-19 transmission occurring when people aren’t near each other and
that particles of up to 100 microns can stay in the air, proximity isn’t
a reliable measure for exposure and downplays how transmissible
COVID-19 is. Canada’s digital contact tracing app uses 2 metres as a
proximity measure, but you can be infected from distances much
farther{two-m} and many factors (like masking and air filtration) play into what distance is "safe".

[quote, '(Qureshi et al., 2020)']
____
A one-size-fits-all 2-metre social distancing rule is not consistent
with the underlying science of exhalations and indoor air. Such rules
are based on an over-simplistic picture of viral transfer, which assume
a clear dichotomy between large droplets and small airborne droplets
emitted in isolation without accounting for the exhaled air. The reality
involves a continuum of droplet sizes and an important role of the
exhaled air that carries them. Smaller airborne droplets laden with
SARS-CoV-2 may spread up to 8 metres concentrated in exhaled air from
infected individuals, even without background ventilation or airflow.
Whilst there is limited direct evidence that live SARS-CoV-2 is
significantly spread via this route, there is no direct evidence that it
is not spread this way.

With surface spreading viruses or fluid (liquid) spreading viruses, we
don’t need to be near someone to get sick. People can get infected with
cholera by using water from a stream that could be miles away from the
infected person. We need to be in contact with that surface or fluid to
get sick. In fact, there are several cases of COVID-19 transmission between
people who have never seen each other, but have breathed the same air via air
conditioning{covid-air-conditioning}.

=== We get sick by interacting with the virus via contaminated air, not just by being near an infected person.

In virology lecture we are taught that airborne particles can be
respiratory droplets or aerosolised particles. Respiratory droplets
eventually fall to the ground, while aerosolised particles can linger in
the air.

:taiwan-ignores-cdc: footnote:[https://twitter.com/JayCityExplore/status/1476868848393535498[Taiwan Rejects CDC Guidance on 5-day Quarantine as imported cases have been found to be infectious up-to 12 days after testing positive.]]

At the beginning of the pandemic, WHO made the erroneous judgement that
COVID-19 was spread through respiratory droplets that eventually fell
onto surfaces and then infect those that touch those surfaces. This
mistake led Western nations to slap a sanitizer machine at every
building entrance, increase their sanitization of desks and more surface
focused cleaning{deep-cleaning}. On the contrary, many Asian countries
have ignored the CDC{taiwan-ignores-cdc}, acting on research
that paints COVID-19 as a much more infectious virus than WHO and
Western nations think. And it seems to have paid off.

Why did WHO decide that COVID-19 wasn’t airborne? Well, since
transmission was thought to occur through sneezes, coughs, etc, that
expel large respiratory droplets, WHO thought that these respiratory
droplets would just fall to the ground. Lots of medical experts were
making the assumption that most viruses weren’t airborne since particles
were bigger than 5 micronsfootnote:science-screwup-airborne[Molteni, M. (2021,
May 13).
https://www.wired.com/story/the-teeny-tiny-scientific-screwup-that-helped-covid-kill/[_The
60-Year-Old Scientific Screwup That Helped Covid Kill_]. Wired.].
However, maybe respiratory droplets do stay in the air longer than we thought.

There’s a historyfootnote:science-screwup-airborne[] that may have been a reason
why WHO acted the way they did.

[quote, Megan Molteni, 'https://www.wired.com/story/the-teeny-tiny-scientific-screwup-that-helped-covid-kill/[The 60-Year-Old Scientific Screwup That Helped Covid Kill]']
____
In 1934, Wells and his wife, Mildred Weeks Wells, a physician, analyzed
air samples and plotted a curve showing how the opposing forces of
gravity and evaporation acted on respiratory particles. The couple’s
calculations made it possible to predict the time it would take a
particle of a given size to travel from someone’s mouth to the ground.
According to them, particles bigger than 100 microns sank within
seconds. Smaller particles stayed in the air. Randall paused at the
curve they’d drawn. To her, it seemed to foreshadow the idea of a
droplet-aerosol dichotomy, but one that should have pivoted around 100
microns, not 5.
____

So what happened? Why haven’t we been using the 100 micron metric? Well,

[quote, Megan Molteni, 'https://www.wired.com/story/the-teeny-tiny-scientific-screwup-that-helped-covid-kill/[The 60-Year-Old Scientific Screwup That Helped Covid Kill]']
____
Part of medical rhetoric is understanding why certain ideas take hold
and others don’t. So as spring turned to summer, Randall started to
investigate how Wells’ contemporaries perceived him. That’s how she
found the writings of Alexander Langmuir, the influential chief
epidemiologist of the newly established CDC. Like his peers, Langmuir
had been brought up in the Gospel of Personal Cleanliness, an obsession
that made handwashing the bedrock of US public health policy. He seemed
to view Wells’ ideas about airborne transmission as retrograde, seeing
in them a slide back toward an ancient, irrational terror of bad air—the
"miasma theory" that had prevailed for centuries. Langmuir dismissed
them as little more than "interesting theoretical points."
____

And then after Langmuir disparaged Well’s work he came up with this:

[quote, Megan Molteni, 'https://www.wired.com/story/the-teeny-tiny-scientific-screwup-that-helped-covid-kill/[The 60-Year-Old Scientific Screwup That Helped Covid Kill]']
____
In the report, Langmuir cited a few studies from the 1940s looking at
the health hazards of working in mines and factories, which showed the
mucus of the nose and throat to be exceptionally good at filtering out
particles bigger than 5 microns. The smaller ones, however, could slip
deep into the lungs and cause irreversible damage. If someone wanted to
turn a rare and nasty pathogen into a potent agent of mass infection,
Langmuir wrote, the thing to do would be to formulate it into a liquid
that could be aerosolized into particles smaller than 5 microns, small
enough to bypass the body’s main defenses. Curious indeed. Randall made
a note.
____

Langmuir did eventually shift his tone and accept that airborne
infection was possible. After Well’s died, Langmuir delivered a speech
stating "problematic particles—the ones they had to worry about—were
smaller than 5 micronsallfootnote:science-screwup-airborne[]." And that screw up started it .
However, particles that are up to 100 microns are also airborne!

:cough-droplets: footnote:[https://www.materials-talks.com/droplet-sizing-of-coughs-and-sneezes/[Droplet sizing of coughs and sneezes]]

While most viruses are 0.1 to 0.5 microns, viruses hitch a ride on the
droplets that we produce when breathing, sneezing or coughing. From this
experiment{cough-droplets} there are droplets that measure at below or
around 100 microns. This means someone’s sneeze can travel around a
room.

'''''

Okay, that was a lot of reading. I wanted to set up why the virus being
airborne is important and how digital contact tracing misses on this.
Digital contact tracing apps seems like a fun algorithmic problem to
determine who’s been near whom! Which is just another complex public
health and social problem reduced into a algorithm. It seemed perfect.

But the app is missing a lot of context. For one, depending on whether
or not the air is actively being filtered, being 6 ft (or 2 metres) may
be enough distance, or it might not be. And depending on one’s mask,
this further complicates what distance and time you can inhale infected
air is "safe" from being exposed to infection, The app simply doesn’t
know, and giving erroneous information is worse than no information. The
app doesn’t know anything about the quality of the air. Distance doesn’t
matter so much if the air is being constantly filtered. A CO2 monitor
would be more helpful than an app that tells me if I’ve been near a sick
person. Basically, the app totally simplifies and neglects how air
transmission works. The only way you can tell if you’ve been exposed is
if you have a CO2 monitor telling you if the air is being recirculated and 
  whether it is being filtered enough such that you aren’t breathing in the air other people exhale.

Since COVID-19 virus is airborne, one should assume no distance and time
near infected air is safe, unless they had data to tell them otherwise.
For instance, it would be useful to know if I was in a restaurant or
building that had bad air quality. Much of the public has no access to
knowledge of whether their air is being filtered or not, or the quality
of the filter. If we aren’t able to access high quality, real time data
on positive cases, understanding our air quality is the next best piece
of data we can use to make informed choices.

As Ali Alkhatibfootnote:ali-digital-contact-tracing[https://ali-alkhatib.com/blog/digital-contact-tracing[We Need to Talk About Digital Contact Tracing]]
says in his blog post "We Need to Talk About Digital Contact Tracing"":

____
Digital contact tracing systems that render the world as normally
distributed space with spheres of influence and contact characterized by
radio waves will consistently leave us with dangerously wrong pictures
of our exposure.
____

I’ve mostly been discussing science, but please check out his blog post
to learn how digital contact tracing excludes the most vulnerable,
gathers unrepresentative data, how proximal tracing doesn’t maintain
privacy and how proximity is a dangerously simple way to model and think
about COVID-19 transmission.

=== To get infected, viruses require affinity and avidity with the human receptor.

There’s a lot of chemistry, physics and biology involved in getting
infected. First, the physics of viruses. Viruses spread through surface,
liquid and air. The physics for each medium is different, and it’s
important we all have some basic understanding of how to prevent
transmission given the medium of spread.

To become infected, viruses require affinity and avidity. What does this mean? Well it’s
time for chemistry. Affinity is how strongly two molecules will react
with each other. We can think of this as the binding event between the
virus and human receptor. The stronger the binding event, the better.
More specifically if the virus has more affinity to bind than the native
molecule that usually binds to the human receptor, then the virus is on
its first step to infecting us. Next, we must have avidity, which is the
accumulated strength of multiple
affinitiesfootnote:[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avidity[Avidity]].
Affinity isn’t always enough, thus, if there’s more virus than native
molecule, the higher concentration of virus can out compete the native
molecule. Once some threshold is met, you are infected.

Figure is from this paper{binding-figure}.

And the biology is how our body responds. Our immune tries it's best to prevent
the virus from damaging our body, but COVID-19 can cause "collateral tissue
damage and systemic failure"footnote:[Trougakos, I.P., Stamatelopoulos, K., Terpos, E. et al. Insights to SARS-CoV-2 life cycle, pathophysiology, and rationalized treatments that target COVID-19 clinical complications. J Biomed Sci 28, 9 (2021). https://doi.org/10.1186/s12929-020-00703-5].

Okay, so what does this mean? There are some things we can’t control, like how a
virus spreads or which human receptor the virus will bind to and how strongly
that virus will bind. But there are some things we can control, like avidity
(how many virus particles) and our immune response. We can control our avidity
to a virus by wearing high quality masks and requesting better air filtration or
choosing to increase access to outdoor air. We can control our immune response
by getting vaccines.

Unfortunately, education on proper masks has been non-existent, with
some health leaders suggesting that cloth masks are still okay to wear
(they aren’tfootnote:[https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/10/commentary-what-can-masks-do-part-1-science-behind-covid-19-protection[COMMENTARY: What can masks do? Part 1: The science behind COVID-19 protection]]).

Contact tracing apps make it easy to forget the physics, chemistry and
biology of viruses. These apps boil viruses down to exposure time and
proximity to infected individuals. Many important factors like the
method of spread, avidity and immune response are pushed to the
sidelines with software solutions, with millions of dollars going into
these apps.

== Testing and Variants

=== Testing

The Canada digital tracking app requires a one time key to use if you
have a confirmed positive case of COVID-19. I would assume this means
those who don’t have access to tests wouldn’t be able to self report
their positive case or if they were feeling symptoms (I’m not sure).

This goes against the advice that the paper gives:

[quote, '(Ferretti et al., 2020)']
____
"If testing capacity is limited, individuals who are identified by
tracing may be presumed confirmed upon onset of symptoms, because the
prior probability of them being positive is higher than for the index
case, accelerating the algorithm further without compromising
specificity.""
____

Much of the success of the app relies on quickly and accurately
detecting positive cases with testing. However, with variants that
aren’t always showing up on rapid tests, the delay of results with PCR
tests, lack of accessibility and economic barriers to testing, this severely
limits who can get tested.

Until we have faster, more accurate, more accessible and cheaper tests,
the accuracy of digital tracking apps will be pretty low.

As of now, there seems to be no way to report a self test.

The main goal of the digital tracking app is to notify and allow someone
to self-isolate before they even begin showing symptoms or infecting
others. Without access to tests, this makes it very hard to achieve this
notion of instantaneous contact tracing. Days matter a lot when trying
to prevent the spreading of COVID-19.

=== Viruses mutate at random. A lot.

But viruses don’t mutate everywhere at random. We’ve observed with
COVID-19 variants and other coronaviruses that there are some conserved
regions that undergo mutation a lot less. For instance, the residues of
the substrate-binding pocket are highly conservedfootnote:[Anas Shamsi,
Taj Mohammad, Saleha Anwar, Mohamed F. AlAjmi, Afzal Hussain, Md. Tabish
Rehman, et al. Glecaprevir and Maraviroc are high-affinity inhibitors of
SARS-CoV-2 main protease: possible implication in COVID-19 therapy.
Biosci Rep. 2020 26 June 2020;40(6): BSR20201256. doi:
https://doi.org/10.1042/BSR20201256] and don’t really undergo much
mutation, since this protein is essential to replication and proteolytic
processing.

But the spike protein on the other hand goes through a lot of mutation.
For instance, many Omicron’s
mutationsfootnote:[https://covariants.org/variants/21K.Omicron[Variant:
21K (Omicron)]] are associated with the ACE2 receptor binding and
antibody binding sites (our vaccines currently target these proteins).

Mutations are random, but the random mutations that survive
current drugs and vaccines are the mutations that will continue to
spread. Mutations that occur on proteins like the main protease may also
occur, but some mutations are more deadly to the virus than others, and
these mutated viruses simply cease to replicate, ending their ability to
spread.

With that being said, for current drugs and vaccines to continue
working, we have to slow down the chance for the virus mutate. The
likelihood of mutation increases as more and more people become
infected. This means we must prevent infection.

People will argue that infection is mild, but getting infected isn’t
just about getting infected. It’s about whether you become the new
reservoir to the next COVID-19 variant.

Digital contact tracing apps can give someone an over simplified model
of how COVID-19 transmits; using proximity doesn’t make much sense since
the virus can stick around in the air and viral load is dependent on a
lot of factors like masking and air filtration. The longer
and more we get infected, the more variants there will be. It’s time to
ditch the app and go back to tracking data and using methods like
masking and air filtration; methods that work.

== Adoption of the app by the public

I was excited by the announcement of Canada’s digital tracking app after
hearing about the success in South Korea and China. However, as I
highlighted above, I later uninstalled app because no one was using it.

The paperfootnote:original-paper[] mentions some important
points. Firstly, in China the app was a success because:

[quote, '(Ferretti et al., 2020)']
____
Public health policy was implemented using an app that was not
compulsory but was required to move between quarters and into public
spaces and public transport.
____

Obviously, that sort of adoption has not happened in Canada and probably
will not. Only 15-20% of the Canada’s population has installed the app.
If we play with some simulations here and assume 20% of Canadians will
self-isolate, maybe assuming 20% of infections will be stopped, this is
still not enough to move COVID-19 into endemic phase. This
analysisfootnote:[https://ncase.me/covid-19/[What Happens Next? COVID-19
Futures, Explained With Playable Simulations]] done quite early during
the pandemic, which was based on early research and the less
transmissible original COVID-19 variant, states we only need to stop 60%
of infections.

Other points the paper mentions, such as:

[quote, '(Ferretti et al., 2020)']
____
Successful and appropriate use of the app relies on it commanding
well-founded public trust and confidence.
____

Is unlikely to occur in a Western society where people are more
independent and less trusting of their governments.

Also claims such as: 

[quote, '(Ferretti et al., 2020)']
---
The intention is not to impose the technology as
a permanent change to society, but we believe that under these pandemic
circumstances it is necessary and justified to protect public health.
---

[quote, '(Ferretti et al., 2020)']
____
It is noteworthy that the algorithmic approach we propose avoids the
need for coercive surveillance, because the system can have very large
impacts and achieve sustained epidemic suppression even with partial
uptake.
____

are discussed in Ali Alkhatib’sfootnote:ali-digital-contact-tracing[] blog post.
All in all, I see a low chance for the app gaining a large enough
adoption for the app to become an accurate tool to use as a means to
decreasing infections.

== Conclusion

For a digital contact tracing app to have some impact on reducing infections we need: 
* access to lots of quick and accurate tests 
* a preventative mindset towards being exposed, as outlined in the paper:
"If testing capacity is limited, individuals who are identified by
tracing may be presumed confirmed upon onset of symptoms, because the
prior probability of them being positive is higher than for the index
case."
* ability for people to upload self confirmed tests to the app 
* adoption of the app by 60%footnote:[I use 60% as outlined above, but I don’t
actually know what number would be needed to reduce the R value. In countries
like China, adoption has been near 100%.] of the population 
* people to actually self-isolate until they are no longer sick 
* a better way to measure exposure risk: using masking and air filtration to predict
exposure risk or understanding that the virus can linger in the air, so
letting users know if they have been in the same location as someone who
was infected, regardless of how far or how long they were near that
infected individual

_However_, to prevent new variants and prevent long COVID I believe we
must work towards no infections at all, not just reducing infections. I
understand this is a more extreme stance, but drug and vaccine
development simply will always lag behind the virus, and developing
drugs and vaccines isn’t easy! Since 100% (or even 50%) adoption and
*use* of the app isn’t feasible, I don’t think digital contact tracing
works in a Western society.

It’s not worth the time and money to keep trying to use digital contact
tracing apps at this stage. Alberta spent $4.3 millionfootnote:[https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/158-albertans-with-covid-19-reported-their-illness-to-province-s-multimillion-dollar-app-1.6202636[158 Albertans with COVID-19 reported their illness to province’s multimillion-dollar app]]
on their digital contact tracing app, which only notified 1,500 people of possible
exposure.

We *know* what works. Such as good quality masks, air filtration and UV learning
(in the air, not surfaces) to limit viral load or inactivate the virus. We also
have have the ability to measure metrics that can help us predict areas of
increasing infection (waste water tracking) and possible exposure risk (CO2
monitoring). *In a Western society, the digital contact tracing app will not get
us out of the pandemic.*
