_Update: Jan 2022_

== A note
I used to be involved with organizing hackathons and speaking at them. Unfortunately, I don't vibe with hackathons anymore. When I was in my first year of university, everyone around me (computer science students) was buzzing about hackathons, so I thought I had to attend and like hackathons. 

However, the environment and atmosphere of hackathons were soon unappealing to me. Move fast and break things. Sit for 8 hours and eat junk food. Kiss up to companies. Hack together a prototype. These mantras were all against who I was: I liked to sit and think and stare, eat vegetables and move around, do projects slowly and little by little, and I never cared about working for a company before attending a hackathon. 

So why keep going to hackathons and organizing them if hackathons didn't align with my work style, thought processes, and life goals? 

I don't know if I will continue to speak at hackathons because many hackathons don't align with my values anymore, so it wouldn't make sense for me to be active in hackathons, even as an external speaker. I may do 1:1 mentoring or coffee chats instead. If any of my workshop/panel topics interest you, please reach out by email, LinkedIn, or Twitter.

== On with the post

I’ve attended a few hackathons, in-person and remote, and at first, a
hackathon seemed like the perfect event. Free food, tech companies, and
swag? What else could you ask for? Well, under all the free food and
company shirts lies copy-pasted Stack Overflow code, dry eyes, and more.
Attending hackathons now seems like a chore I need to check off as a
computer science student. And frankly, I feel guilty for feeling this
way. But after reading Design Justicefootnote:[Costanza-Chock, S. (2020). Design Justice. The MIT Press.],
this blog post from Jackyfootnote:[https://jzhao.xyz/posts/hackathons[Hacking the Hackathon]], and various
other posts such as thisfootnote:[https://www.quora.com/Why-might-someone-really-like-programming-contests-but-have-no-desire-to-go-to-a-hackathon[Why
might someone really like programming contests but have no desire to go to a hackathon?]],

thisfootnote:[https://thedailytexan.com/2018/05/02/fall-out-of-love-with-the-hackathon/[Fall out of love with the Hackathon]]
I’ve realized that everything I feel towards hackathons is valid. For some context, I started going to
hackathons in 2019 in my first year of university, so my hackathon
experience may not match yours. These are purely my own experiences and
may not reflect the majority of hackathon experiences.

== My stomach and head hurt; all the health problems!

When I attend a hackathon, I always plan for the next day to be a
recovery day. From sore eyes to a constipated stomach, a throbbing
headache, and back pain, that’s the type of day I can expect right after
a hackathon. The impact hackathons have on my health is a major reason I
stopped attending.

Something like the hackathon diet always messes up my digestion for
anywhere from a day to a week. I’m easily constipated by a lack of
vegetables and a high intake of junk food. For instance, a hackathon
diet made of a glass of orange juice and bagel, a few slices of pizza,
and Chinese takeout is low in protein, vitamins, and minerals and high
in fat, sodium, and sugar. And this is without the energy drinks and
snacks one may eat throughout a hackathon. For me, a day eating at a
hackathon causes painful bloating and constipation the next day.

Hackathons rarely offer healthy alternatives, aside from some fruit at
breakfast, and it makes eating difficult for me. Yes, I could bring my
food but that involves packing 3 meals, carrying those meals around, and
making sure those meals don’t go bad. And having healthy options is
always a positive, as it’s proven eating unhealthy food makes you think
and respond slowly - everyone wants maximum brainpower at a hackathon,
right?

Additionally, the lack of sleep nearly every participant will experience
can cause anything from a slower cognitive response to a throbbing
headache. Then there’s the back pain from sitting all day and the dry
eyes from staring at a screen. And leg pains from sitting cross-legged
if you’re me. A hackathon forces your body in awkward positions for
hours.

Unfortunately, this is what you can expect at 99% of hackathons.

== A dumpster fire of JavaScript, corporate APIs, AI, and stuff I don’t understand from Stack Overflow

I have a burning hate for JavaScript (I’m sorry). JavaScript with a
couple of APIs from Google (hopefully a blockchain deep learning API)
and Stack Overflow posts gives you the typical hackathon project. This
type of project is "built fast" and breaks even faster. I also believe
that hackathons perpetuate the cycle of using JavaScript for everything
and anything (which I do not agree with). One might argue JavaScript
allows for an idea to quickly turn into a product, which is true and
very attractive at a hackathon. But if you want that JavaScript product
to last, you’re going to need a team and a lot of time just to maintain
it. Now using another programming language like Reason might take longer
to create a product, but the time needed to maintain and fix bugs in a
project in Reason is almost
nonefootnote:[https://reasonml.github.io/blog/2017/09/08/messenger-50-reason[Messenger.com Now 50% Converted to Reason]].

____
Messenger used to receive bugs reports daily; since the introduction of
Reason, there have been a total of 10 bugs (that’s during the whole
year, not per week)!
____

and

____
Refactoring speed went from days to hours to dozens of minutes.
____

In a world of exploding technological innovation, thinking about
sustainability and maintainability is a must when building a product.
And I believe using JavaScript is not the answer to creating sustainable
or maintainable technology. This is my very personal opinion. Will I
still work on projects with JavaScript, like at work? Unfortunately yes.
But in my own time, I will be staying away from JavaScript as much as I
can.

Additionally, I don’t learn much by hastily copying a piece of code from
Stack Overflow or using an API endpoint that does everything for me. And
to be frank, there is no way I will produce any remotely helpful or
useful in 24 hours. Much less so a functional product. Can some people
do it? Maybe, but the vast majority of hackers have no understanding or
a basic and lacking understanding of the context of an issue. This leads
to my next point below…

== What are we trying to solve here?

It’s funny how a microbiology class fundamentally changed the way I went
about thinking about solving problems. In MICB 202, I learned about
cholera, an acute diarrhoeal infection caused by ingesting water or food
contaminated with the bacterium Vibrio cholerae. How would one go about
reducing the number of cases of cholera? Well, by cleaning up the water.
But how? Using chemicals? Using energy to kill off bacteria? While these
are solutions, there’s one thing we are forgetting about: the context of
the problemfootnote:[Colwell, R. R., Huq, A., Islam, M. S., Aziz, K. M.
A., Yunus, M., Khan, N. H., … Russek-Cohen, E. (2003). Reduction of
cholera in Bangladeshi villages by simple filtration. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 100(3), 1051–1055. doi:10.1073/pnas.0237386100], and those who are actually affected. The
context is that the location (Bangladeshi villages) where cholera is
still an issue is in places where water is used for everything, usually
not being filtered or cleaned before the water is used. The water that
people use to drink is also used for washing. So you can’t just dump
chemicals into the rivers and hope for the best. Additionally, there’s a
lack of resources. Who’s going to synthesize chemicals and where would
you even purify the water? Even boiling water would be a strain on
resources (it would be better to use firewood for heating or cooking).
To someone that is unfamiliar with the context of the issue, it’s easy
to slap a solution together and actually cause more harm than good.

So what was the solution the researchers came up with? The solution is
quite simple and is a solution that can be easily adopted and pushed out
into the public. It was to use a
sarifootnote:[https://www.encyclopedia.com/places/asia/iranian-political-geography/sari[Sari]],
a piece of cloth worn by Hindu women, but also now frequently worn by
women of other religious groups. This solution is one I didn’t even
think of when my professor presented the case study in class. Why? Well
because I didn’t have a good or even basic understanding of the context
of the problem, such as the cultural practices.

____
It is common practice in villages in Bangladesh to use cloth, frequently
a flat, unfolded piece of an old sari, to filter home-prepared drinks.
In laboratory experiments employing electron microscopy, we found that
inexpensive sari cloth, folded four to eight times, provides a filter of
≈20-μm mesh size, small enough to remove all zooplankton, most
phytoplankton, and all V. cholerae attached to plankton and particulates
>20 μm. Laboratory studies showed that sari cloth folded at least four
times retained the V. cholerae cells attached to plankton, effectively
removing >99% (>2 logs) of V. cholerae (30).

Hackathons occur very frequently in privileged Western societies that
are so isolated from the world. This means the context of a problem is
ignored, and this results in most solutions being useless, or even
worse, harmful. Hackers go away with the feeling that problems are easy
to solve and that technology is a bandaid for all problems, which is
simply not true. These tweets below also offer insight into my thoughts:

I’ve seen horrible takes on hackathon projects trying to solve a
problem. One was an "eating disorder diagnosis" and "treatment"
project, which was a static website involving the user filling in a
multiple choice quiz (to determine if they had an eating disorder) and
then very generic tips for someone with an eating disorder.

First of all, anyone can have an eating disorder, and these types of
quizzes can lead someone to believe they don’t have an eating disorder
when they do.

Additionally, generic tips like "don’t look at calories" or "make
sure you are eating a balanced meal" are phrases people with eating
disorders can warp and bend into dangerous behaviour. If someone decides
to stop looking at calories, they may just eat as little as possible
because they live in fear of overeating and have no way to check if they
are eating enough if they don’t look at calories. Part of my recovery
was calorie counting to make sure I was eating enough.

As someone who has had an eating disorder, I understand the intention is
to help. But some things (like recovering from or diagnosing an eating disorder)
cannot be solved with a web app.

*We have to stop slapping code on everything and realize sometimes (most
times), problems would be better off without the intervention of
websites and phone apps.*

== Not beginner-friendly if you don’t already know how to do everything

While hackathons are great places to be introduced to so many new
concepts, are they the best place to learn and understand these new
concepts? Hackathons celebrate this culture of "move fast and break
things", and this implies that one must learn fast too. I don’t know
about you, but I don’t learn fast, and especially not if I’ve been
eating nothing but chocolate candy bars for the past 5 hours. Coupled
with learning about something I’m not interested in, such as a company
tool for a prize category, hackathons have made me lose the joy of
learning about technology. It’s also demotivating to see a team of
highly skilled individuals who come into an hackathon with every move
planned out; not everyone has the time to plan for a hackathon weekend.
And I am not as skilled as someone who’s been programming since high
school. Always feeling "behind" others is partially why I felt like
dropping out of computer science, which propelled my decision to pursue
a minor in biochemistryfootnote:[link:/posts/money-molecules-third-year[I've now changed my major to a combined major in computer science and chemistry]].

I’m a slow learner, and I’m slowly (haha) coming to terms with that. I’m
also rediscovering the privilege of learning about things you’re
interested in for no goal but to learn about these things; I’m not
trying to become the next Elon Musk. For instance, I’ve recently become
interested in developer tooling like
Semanticfootnote:[https://github.com/github/semantic[Semantic]] and
strongly typed programming languages like Haskell and ReScript. I’m
learning them when I feel like it and as slow as I want to. I’m also a
chemistry nerd at heart, so I’ve added a biochemistry minor to my degree
for no purpose but to nerd out in biochemistry.

== So what am I doing now?

I’m not attending hackathons until I see that hackathons can become
places where you are only expected to learn and to tinker, and there’s
no pressure to become the next startup or solve some worldwide (or
local) problem. I’ve also stopped organizing hackathons. I’m also just learning topics that interest me,
in my free time and at school.
