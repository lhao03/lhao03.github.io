I felt a sense of eagerness I hadn't in a long time when the new school year started. It was like a fog was lifted in my 5th year of undergrad when I transferred into the chemistry and computer science combined major. As a fifth-year student, I thought I had honed in on the craft of being a university student. I had taken countless courses in different subjects and different year levels. I thought I was decent at juggling multiple courses and responsibilities. I thought that this year was going to be my year. 

But that fog slowly set in again, and I made decision after decision that went against my gut instinct and ultimately harmed my mental and physical health. I was scared of rejection if I didn't please others, and I continually made decisions that weren't prioritizing my own goals. Decisions that weren't protecting my mental health and wellbeing And when the mornings started to become as dark as the nights, all I could feel was rage at myself for thinking too slowly, reacting the wrong way, or misinterpreting events around me. I was mad at myself for being human, which ironically was a very human thing to do.

When I started doing my computer science major, I gave myself the grace to "mess up" because I didn't know anything about computer science. I permitted myself to learn. But I didn't give myself that same grace for chemistry, because I was supposed to be good at chemistry. In junior high and high school I used my grades in chemistry as evidence that I was inherently good at chemistry. My teachers had parroted that idea to me as well, whether that was in good faith (not really) or because of the model minority myth, who knows? So at the young age of 13, I decided I was going to become a scientist who did chemistry. However, that image of myself I had dreamt of and plastered on a wall inside my mind when I was 13 years old was crumbling day by day. And I didn't know how to deal with it. I approached my chemistry courses with the mindset that the concepts would quickly and easily make sense to me. And when my statistical thermodynamics course started to sound like a cacophony instead of a symphony, I panicked. Whenever I got lost in reviewing a concept I felt too nervous and anxious to continue learning, so I stopped. When I reached the point in learning where my head started throbbing, I panicked, because I had never felt that way in high school (or first and second-year chemistry courses). 

When I was in elementary school, I became friends with my neighbors, who had a backyard with a hot tub and swing. And because I had a trampoline, we would frequently play in each other's backyards. The brother and sister duo became my first real friends. One day, when they asked me to play with them, my parents told them I was busy doing schoolwork. When those neighbors packed up and moved away, I didn't bother becoming friends with the new neighbors, because I was busy doing math workbooks. That was how a lot of my time looked up until high school. School was easy because I had already seen everything the teacher was teaching, not because I truly knew how to learn. I think my parents were doing the process of learning for me, allowing me to see the content multiple times explained in different ways. In high school, I would study until I collapsed and achieve high grades that way. In fact, for every exam, I'd study until I couldn't open my eyes and write exams while being on 6 hours of sleep. I'd do this for every subject, especially chemistry. Slowly, I realized that I wasn't inherently good at chemistry. I had either already learned the material before, or I was young and healthy enough to brute-force memorize everything for hours on end in a high school.

With that being said, not only was I not properly learning, but I was too scared to face the fact that I didn't know or understand my courses. In my quantum chemistry course and my statistical thermodynamics course I found myself feeling lost for as long as 3 lectures in a row, which was when the panic was enough to turn into fear, which finally forced me to sit down and try to learn the content. With fear as a driving force to propel my learning, I yearned to do things that could feed my self-esteem and make me forget about the content I needed to learn; things that were "easy" to do. 

That easy task was working on the https://2023.igem.wiki/ubc-vancouver[UBC iGEM Wiki]. During my first week of midterms, I spent more time working on the iGEM wiki than studying for 3 midterms, and I paid the price by performing horribly on my midterms. I did so horribly that I had one of many breakdowns that led me to rethink my priorities, time management skills, and who I trusted. Seeing bad grades caused a huge dip in my self-esteem, and rage that I didn't know who to direct towards, besides myself. To keep the story short and to keep events private, over half the iGEM team had lost faith in our project, and leadership was not transparent to the remaining members of the team with how poorly the project was panning out. With blind faith, this led me to over-commit my time, in which if I had known how badly our project was lacking, I would have not given my time and energy to develop the wiki (which was an easy but time-consuming task). I've now learned this behavior (working on a task that is easier and less important) is called the https://thedecisionlab.com/biases/bikeshedding[bike shedding effect].

After my first set of midterms, I did better on my second set of midterms, but I knew the way I was spending my time reviewing was not optimal. For computer science courses, I actively reviewed my lectures, redoing problems and solving practice questions vs. passively staring at slides. But in high school, I had passively studied for all my courses with success, so I applied that to my chemistry courses; this yielded horrible results. Looking back now, it's hard to understand why I would actively review for computer science but not for chemistry. However, I was doing what felt familiar and safe to me, because passive studying (reading slides or rewriting notes) doesn't push you out of your comfort zone. It doesn't challenge your ability to apply concepts. Passively reviewing didn't cause me to panic, but I wasn't learning anything. When I started studying for finals, finally decided I needed to face the fear and panic I felt when I didn't understand a concept. I collected all the practice questions I could find and did all of them. Sometimes I'd only do 3 questions in an hour. Sometimes I only did one. Only when I exhausted all practice questions did I allow myself to go back to passively reviewing? While I was doing practice questions I felt moments of panic but I kept pushing through because I knew logically doing questions was rigorously testing my ability to apply concepts, which passive studying could not do. 

This year has taught me many hard things. With my mental health sliding lower and lower, it became harder to remember to practice physical health. I became obsessed with more explosive and heavyweight-focused workouts, leaving me out of breath but also stiff and sore the days after. I had to resort to physiotherapy because my back became so stiff it was painful to bend over and sit down. Recently, I have tried incorporating more stretching and pilates into my workouts, which emphasizes a more controlled and structured way of moving your body. I've exercised since I was 13, with a single goal of burning as many calories as possible, but recently I've decided to exercise to become strong, agile, and flexible.

Here are three things I learned in 2023:

1. effective leadership is hard; being passionate is not enough

2. learning is hard

3. staying healthy is hard
