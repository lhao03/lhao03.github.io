* high school curriculum: teaching fashionable programming languages and
currently popular programming paradigms.
** repeated in introductory university programs
* imaginative programming: weds programming to algorithm through use of
rich media => use mathematics as a programming language
** composition of functions and expressions
** aligning programming with mathematics will fail unless the
programming language is as close to school mathematics as possible
* complexity of object-orientated programming bears little fruit
** it makes no sense teach students how to engineer structure of large
programs when they are yet to write any programs with a complexity worth
structuring
