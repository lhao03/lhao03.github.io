== points about dna
*  no preexisting media 
*  detached from array based structure (metadata encoded within each dna segment)
*  error characteristics

== overview 
. encoding
    *  turning binary into ternary into bases
    *  more error prone sequences should be avoided
. synthesis
. storage
. retrieval 
. sequencing
. decoding

== application, presentation, session
*  done in binary 
*  application: how is this storage to be used? 
**  most likely archival 
*  presentation: preparation of bitstreams
*  session: access to the DNA storage interface
**  object based

== DNA channel
*  takes bitstream or digital object from session layer and processes those bits 
*  implemented as software codec
*  when bitstream is presented: 
**  packetization: longest strand of DNA that can be currently made (300 bases), so the bitsreams must be broken down
*** add indices to each segment
** error correction: add redundant information to reduce probability of random errors
*** augment segments (inner code) or add segments (outer code)
** translation: binary to bases 
** transformations: repeated bases (homopolymers), high proportion of G and C and some other patterns can cause errors

== DNA physical layer
*  synthesis (writing)
    - silcon technology based implementations that miniaturize synthesis device
*  storage 
    - store in dry and chemically inert environment
    - organized with physical tape system
*  reading (sequencing)
    - sequencing-by-synthesis: high accuracy, high latency
    - nanopore sequencing: lower latency,  lower accuracy
*  retrieval (important for DNA storage!)
    - easy: read entire archive
    - if multiple objects stored in archive, random access operations are required
* PCR and DNA pull-out with magngetic nanoparticles
** PCR:
*** session layer assign a set of object IDs, and at encoding time channal layer appends a set of predefined DNA base sequences to both ends of a DNA sequence belonging to an object (target sites)
*** probes (short DNA sequences): that complement target site attach to target molecule along with polymerases
*** now the primers enable polymerase to copy target DNA molecules, creating more DNA molecules of the object of interest than other DNA molecukes
*** result is pool of mostly DNA molecules belonging to object we want
** DNA pull-out  
*** channel layer only needs to append the object IDs as target sites at one end of every DNA sequence belonging to an object
*** probes attached to magnetic nanoparticles
*** probes bind to DNA molecules and can separate them


== problem for our team to investigate
*  make retrieval of information easier
