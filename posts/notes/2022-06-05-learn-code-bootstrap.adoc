NOTE: This post is based on https://www.janestreet.com/tech-talks/curriculumn-design/[Shriram Krishnamurthi's Talk: Curriculum Design as an Engineering Problem]

As computer science becomes more and more popular, middle school and high
school curriculums are changing to capture the skill of computing. In fact,
link:/posts/notes/2022-06-11/ab-cs[Alberta's curriculum] added some computing
to it. I wrote down a summary link:/posts/notes/2022-06-11-ab-cs[here].
I imagine there are many reasons why computer science is being added to the
K-12 curriculum. Some reasons include:

* this notion of "transfer learning", that computational thinking can help students think in other areas
* preparing students for jobs in tech
* computing thought of as a essential skill for the future

Regardless of the reason that computing is being adding to the K-12 curriculum,
the way we deliver this content is important. 

In Professor Shriram's talk, he mentioned four methods that computer science could be delivered to
students. These include making computer science a _required course_, an _elective
course_, an _after school program_, or to _integrate into an already required
course_. I'll briefly list the pros and cons of each method. Bootstrap's three
core goals are *rigor*, *scale*, and *equity*,
which I also agree with them. 

In the university setting, these goals are far easier to achieve than in the high school
or middle school setting. In the university setting, courses are expected to uphold
some standard of rigour. This rigour includes factors like what other
higher-level courses expect from lower-level courses, what students want out of
the course, etc. Scale is also easier to achieve, because of highly
specialized professors at _most_ universities [though this may not be the exact
reason] as well as resources that allow for scalability (like educational technology and teaching assistants).
And finally equity, which means ensuring anyone who wants to take a course, can
take it. Usually in university, most students come from a privileged
background, and have foundational courses they took in high school. Most first
year university students can take the introductory level of computer science.
Additionally, students in university are free to "choose" their own schedule,
so they can choose to take a 3 hours of lecture everyday, or 6 hours.

But at the K-12 setting, rigour, scale and equity is more difficult to achieve,
and often one or more of these goals suffer.

== Required Courses
* not enough room in the day to also teach a computer science course
* how do you find and equip a computer science teacher in every school
** the technology industry pays alot more than being a teacher does
* making a course required means rigour may have to suffer to ensure everyone can pass the course (if the course is required you have to make it simple enough that majority can pass) 
* since the course is required, everyone will be exposed to it, which ensures equity

⬇️  rigour, ⬇️  scale, ⬆️  equity

== Electives
* only students who are already interested in computer science will take the elective, meaning many students will simply not choose to do the elective if they aren't really interested in it/don't know what it's about
* not every school can offer a computer science elective, most likely the case will be that schools in privledged areas serving white/Asian students will be able to offer a computer science elective
* since the course is not required for graduation, it can be rigorous

⬆️  rigour, ⬇️  scale, ⬇️  equity

== After School Programs/Summer Programs
* attendance is variable, and this can make it harder to teach everyone and make lead to volunteers teaching at the individual level or cause students to feel left behind
** this makes it hard to make a program rigorous if there are students who don't attend every session
* not everyone has time after school to attend programs
** usually privledged students will be more likely to attend these programs
* usually run by volunteers, and there is a high turnover rate; 
** you can't really train a volunteer within a short amount of time to deliver concepts well
** hard to get good quality volunteers

? rigour, ⬇️  scale, ⬇️  equity

== Integrated Programs
* there are already teachers that teach required subjects. these teachers can be trained to add some computer science concepts into their daily instruction
* transfer learning is confusing and not always clear. trying to interweave computer science concepts into another subject can leave some students confused or discouraged.
** need to make transfer learning explicit
* since it's required, all students must take it
* the content can't be too difficult because the course is required

⬇️  rigour, ⬆️  scale, ⬆️  equity

== Two Types of Computer Science Programs
=== Bootstrap
* relates back to school
* lot of focus on language of choice and technology of choice, and ensures that the choices are best suited towards teaching students (making sure values match with three goals)
** recognizes and avoids the issues with using mainstream programming languages
* transfer learning is explictly revealed to students
* emphasis on worksheets vs. computer programs. putting computer infront of students makes the "transfer learning" less easy to see. also not every student has a computer and using computer programs doesn't mean the student can continue learning at home
* stepwise 
* careful and thoughtful design put into curriculum
* part of the required curriculum, so many students that may not have done the computer science elective are introduced to computing

=== KodewithKlossy, Code.org, other mainstream coding initatives
* pushing mainstream technology (HTML/CSS/JavaScript/Python) on its students
** are these really the best choices of technology? 
** creating the idea that web development or programming is all there is to computer science (it's not)
* curriculum not rigorous enough
* not representative of a computer science industry
* does not relate back to school
* relies on a student having connection to internet, laptop, etc
* lack of focus on language of instruction and technology of choice
* no "design rules" being taught => it's just a "tinker until it's correct*
* very large emphasis (KodeWithKlossy) placed on creativity, lack of rigour
* usually short scale
** while these types programs expose students to computer science, they often do not
cause a student to decide to pursue a career or post-secondary education in
computer science
