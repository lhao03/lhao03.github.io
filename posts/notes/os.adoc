* use of `#![no_std]` because the standard library requires `libc` which
requires the operating system and because features like files, networking and
threads (part of standard library) require the operating system.

* `#[panic_handler]`: must define a function to run when panic occurs

* language item: special functions and types that are required internally by the compiler
** `eh_personality`: marks a function that is used for stack unwinding
** Rust use unwinding to ensure all memory freed on panic
