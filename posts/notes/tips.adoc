* get promoted in university as quickly as you can (finish your core requirements as quickly as you can; get to the higher-level stuff)

* don't get sucked into the Sunk Cost Fallacy

* start reading papers as soon as you can understand them. Don't spend time trying to understand a paper you're not ready to understand yet.

* don't get sucked into trends and peer pressure (https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/don%E2%80%99t-base-career-decisions-on-glamour-or-fame/[don't base career decisions on glamour or fame])

* math is important and interesting, my biggest regret is fooling around and not paying more attention in my math classes

* theory over skills

* don't buy clothes with the idea that "ill lose weight to fit into this". everytime you look at that clothing you're going to think that. just buy clothing that fits. cheaper clothing that doesn't really fit isnt worth it.
