#+title: 2023 12 30 Spatially Selective Cleavage

** abstract
- enzymatic methods: functional, enzymatic, environmental advantages over phosphoramidite synthesis
    - must be parallelized -> polymerase-nucleotide conjugate cleaved using electrochemical oxidation on microelectrode array
    - developed conjugate maintains polymerase activity toward surface bound substrates with single base control
    - at scale

** intro
- phosphoramidite synthesis: high-throughput
  - expensive, environmentally hazardous organic solvents
- TdT: template-independent polymerase used for extension of growing ssDNA with dNTP
- deblocking: via chemical or photochemical means
  - this paper: electrochemical
- Jung: spatially selective deblocking of 3'aminoxy-protested oligonucleotide with nitrous acid produced along electrochemically generated pH gradient -> lay out pathway to paralization
- extension step: single step dNTP incorporation yeilds with TdT mutants are below those for phosphoramidite synthesis
- electrochemical deblocking step: regulate local nitrosamine concentrations and exposure times to avoid base-substitution in synthesized oligonucleotides
  - need additional engineering of mutant TdT polymerase and develoment of deprotection system
