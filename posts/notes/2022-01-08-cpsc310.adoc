== Lecture 1 (Jan 10):
- software engineering: barrier between computer science and impact on real world
- all deadlines on Friday at 6pm

== Lecture (Jan 19)

=== Black Box Testing
*Pros*
- find high severity bugs (from user POV)
- easy to get started (more clear what to test, client-facing methods)
- less overfitting to implementation: emphasis on specification
- parallelize development and testing (no need to access implementation)

*Cons*
- need well-defined specifications
- intentional handicapa: can't use the implementation
- poor explanability

how to read a specification to write tests:
- input/output equicvalence classes
  - avoid redundant tests
- boundry classes

=== equivalence classes
- patterns on types of inputs
- certain partitions of the input space/output space that has similar behaviour

=== input/output partitioning
- partitioning of all the possible inputs to CUT into equivalence classes which characterize sets of inputs with something in common
- choose representitive to test and if those tests pass all values from that representitive should work
