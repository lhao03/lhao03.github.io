*defining synbio*: 
making biology more modular, robut, simulation, prototyping, standardization, more accessble to the engineering discpline. 
treating biology like a system. design and construction of new biologicla parts, devices and systems.
the redesign of existing natural biological systems for useful purposes. the endeavor to make biology and it's principles accessible to engineers.

*through history*
molecular biology -> molecular biotechnology -> synthethic biology
plasmids: transfer useful properties to e.coli

1. discovery of DNA structure and role in heredity (fundamental science at the moledular level)
2. development of plasmids, systems biology, Sanger DNA Sequencing (fundamental and applied science and the molecular level, fundamantal science at systems level)
3. DNA synthesis, geneti circuits, redesigning phage genome (fundamental and applied science at moledular and system level)

two timelines: 

1. palsson timeline: focus on early developments and synthethic cells

. fundamental basis of synbio (bottom up)
. putting life together -> lets use understand it better 
	. minimalist cells and synthethic chromosomes enable fundamental discoveries about roles genes play in cell viabiliy.

2. collins timeline: focus on development of genetic tools and their applications

. putting life together -> lets us use it better
	. genetic tools let us manipulate cells with more control

DNA synthesis and sequencing important for both

*through purpose*
an engineering discipline -> social, ethical and global implications and financial and commerial applications 


*study and design life to discover truths and benefit society, humans and environment.*
if this is the purpose of synbio, there must be judgement made by governing bodies to regulate and support this intent.

== mosquito, farmers and bio-furturism
. primary medicinal ingredient is artemisinin -> found in Artemisia Annua
. unstable production lead to huge price fluctuations for ACTs

=== natural biosynthesis of artemisinin 
CO2 -> acetyl-CoA -> FPP -> Amorphadiene -> Artemisinic acid -> Dihydroartemisnic acid -> Artemisinin

selection of chassis: important (e.coli which has more scientific research behind it) or an industrially relevant strain or yeast
