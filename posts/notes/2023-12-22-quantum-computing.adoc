points

. first principles
. impact of entanglement
. show quantum kernels can produce regression models of similar accuracy as classical kernels
. entanglement improves accuracy; critical for quantum kernel computation algorithm
. Bayesian optimization is valid strategy for optimizing quantum circuits for quantum regression problems

done on dec 25! will reread again when I fill in my gaps of knowledge
