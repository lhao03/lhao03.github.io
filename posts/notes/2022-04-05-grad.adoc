** no GRE due to COVID
* https://chemistry.berkeley.edu/cbe-research[Chemical Engineering]
** no GRE
* https://chembio.berkeley.edu/[Chemical Biology]
** get into Chemistry PhD first

==== Application Details 
* superior performance and research experience in
past two years of undergrad studies 
* statement of purpose 
* personal history statement 
** The personal statement should give concrete evidence of your promise as a member of the academic community,
giving the committee an image of you as a person. 
** This is also where you represent your potential to bring to your academic career a critical
perspective rooted in a non-traditional educational background, or your
understanding of the experiences of groups historically
under-represented in higher education and your commitment to increase
participation by a diverse population in higher education.

*** how enzymes function as such formidable catalysts 
*** The role of non-covalent interactions between the enzyme and substrate in stabilisation of ground and
transition states has held a particular fascination for me, as well as
the development of methodologies to stabilise or trap intermediates in
catalysis. Increasingly I am becoming interested in applying our
understanding to the development of new tools and hopefully
therapeutics.
