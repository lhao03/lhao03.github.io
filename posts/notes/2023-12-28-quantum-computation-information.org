** 1.2: quantum bits
- mathematical objects with certain specific properties 
- abstract entity: construct a general theory of QC/QI that doesn't depend on specific system
- qubit can be $| 0 \rangle$, $| 1 \rangle$ or a linear combination of states $|\psi \rangle = \alpha | 0 \rangle + \beta | 1 \rangle$ (superposition)
  - vector in 2D space
  - computational basis states: $| 0 \rangle$, $| 1 \rangle$ -> form orthoormal basis for this vector space
  - we cannot examine a qubit to determine it's quantum state
  - qubit's state is unit vector in 2D complex vector space
  - lack of direct correspondence between elements of abstraction and real world with qubits -> there is indirect correspondence for qubit states to be manipulated and transformed to lead to measurement outcomes -> these quantum states have real, experimentally verifiable consequences.
- exist in continuum of states until it is observed
- because $|\alpha|^2 + |\beta|^2 = 1$ we can say: $|\psi \rangle = e^{i \gamma} (cos (\theta/2) + e^{i \phi} sin (\theta / 2))$
    - $\theta$ and $\phi$ define a point on unit three-dimensional sphere (Bloch sphere)
    - Bloch sphere can be used to describe single qubits

- how much information represented by a qubit -> infinite number of points on unit sphere so infinite binary expansion of $\theta$
  - not true: measurement changes the state of qubit, collasping the superposition
    - only 0 or 1, so measurement only returns one state
- would need to measure infinite number of qubits to determine $\alpha$ and $\beta$
  - how much information is represented by a qubit if we do not measure it? -> potential amount of "hidden information" grows exponentially with more qubits

** 1.2.1 multiple qubits
- two qubits have four computational basis states:
  $$|\psi \rangle = \alpha_{00} | 00 \rangle + \alpha_{01} | 01 \rangle + \alpha_{10} | 10 \rangle + \alpha_{11} | 11 \rangle$$
- $\{0,1\}^2$: set of strings of length 2 with each letter either one or zero
- measuring the first qubit as 0 gives probability $|\alpha_{00}|^2 + |\alpha_{01}|^2$ and post-measurement state: $$|\psi ' \rangle = \frac{(\alpha_{00} | 00 \rangle + \alpha_{01} | 01 \rangle)} {\sqrt{|\alpha_{00}|^2 + |\alpha_{01}|^2)}}$$
- important two qubit state: $$\frac{|00\rangle + |11 \rangle}{\sqrt{2}}$$
  - key ingredient in quantum teleportation and superdense coding
- Bell state:
