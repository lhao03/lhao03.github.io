== ch 1: getting started

`Cargo.toml`: manifest file for Rust. - metadata and dependencies
`src/main.rs` where you write code.

`cargo new`: generates a hello world program `cargo run`: run the
program

=== adding dependencies

you find libraries on crates.io, and packages are referred to as crates
`cargo-build` to install the dependency. - running this creates
`Cargo.lock`, which is a log of the exact versions of dependencies we
are using locally.

=== hello world

* indent with four spaces, not tab
* `println!` is a macro; `!` means youâ€™re calling a macro.

=== hello cargo

Cargo.toml `[package]`: indicates following statements are configuring a
package. - Cargo expects source files to live inside `src`. -
`cargo build`: builds executable in `target/debug` - `cargo run`: builds
and runs executable - `cargo check`: check code compiles, but doesnâ€™t
build executable. - `cargo build --release`: your project is ready for
release, creates executable in `target/relesae` and is compiled with
optimizations

== ch 2: programming a guessing game

`::` indicates the function is an associated function for that type.
`&mut var` vs.Â `&var` to make it mutable.

== ch 3: common programming concepts

=== 3.1: variables and mutability

* by default, variables are immutable.
* add `mut` to make it mutable.
* `const` are immutable always.
* shadowing:

[source,rust]
----
let x = 5; // x is 5 here
let x = x + 1; // x is 6 here
{
    let x = x * 2; // x is 12 here
}
// x is 6 here
----

* with shadowing we can perform a few transformations on a value but
have the variable be immutable after those transformations have been
completed.
* another difference between `mut` and shadowing is that by using `let`,
we are creating a new variable; we can change the type of the value and
reuse the same name.

=== 3.2: data types

==== scalar types

* single value: integers, floating-point numbers, Booleans, characters

===== integer types

* to prevent integer overflow
** wrap all modes with `wrapping_*` methods.
** return `None` is there is overflow with `checked_*` methods.
** return value and boolean indicating whether there was overflow with
`overflowing_*` methods.
** saturate at the valueâ€™s min or max values with `saturating_*`
methods.

===== floating-point types

===== boolean type

* one byte #### character type
* 4 bytes in size

==== compound types

==== tuple type

* fixed length
* once declared, cannot grow or shrink in size

[source,rust]
----
let tup = (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);
let (x, y, z) = tup;
let one = x.2;
----

* to get individual values, we use pattern matching or period and index.
* tuple without any value, `()` is special type that has one vane, also
written `()`. the type is called _unit type_ and the value is called
_unit value_.
** expressions implicitly return unit value if they donâ€™t return any
other value

==== arrays

* fixed length
* allocated on stack

[source,rust]
----
let a: [i32; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let a = [3; 5]; // a = [3, 3, 3, 3, 3];
----

=== 3.2: functions

* statements: instructions that perform some action and do not return a
value
* expressions: evaluate to resulting value
* function definitions are statements

[source,rust]
----
fn main() {
    let x = (let y = 6); // this does not work
}
----

* the `let` statement does not return a value, so x has nothing to bind
to.
* expressions include:
** function calls, macro calls, `{}`
* adding `;` to the end of an expression turns it into a statement.

==== funcs with return values

* donâ€™t name return values, but declare type after an arrow

[source,rust]
----
fn five() -> i32 {
    5
}

fn main() {
    let x = five();
}
----

* if we add a semicolon at the end of the return, we get an error.

=== 3.4 control flow

* using loops; you can give loop labels.
* `break` and `continue` apply to the innermost loop at that point.

[source,rust]
----
'outer_loop: loop {
  loop {
    // something happens
    break;
    //something happens
    break 'counting_up;
  }
}
----

* returning values from loops

[source,rust]
----
let result = loop {
  // something happens
  break 10;
}
----

==== looping through a collection with for

* we could use a `while` loop;

[source,rust]
----
    while index < 5 {
        println!("the value is: {}", a[index]);

        index += 1;
    }
----

* but this approach is error prone; program could panic if index or test
condition is wrong.
* also slow; compiler adds runtime code to perform the conditional check
of whether the index is within the bounds of the array on every iter
through the loop.
* more concise is to use `for` loop:

[source,rust]
----
for element in a {
  // do something
}
----

* increased safety of code.

[source,rust]
----
fn main() {
    for number in (1..4).rev() {
        println!("{}!", number);
    }
    println!("LIFTOFF!!!");
}
----

== ch 4: understanding ownership

* enables Rust to make memory safety guarantees without needing a
garbage collector.

=== 4.1: what is ownership

* rust manages memory through a system of ownership with a set of rules
that compiler checks at compile time.
* ownership features do not slow down program whiles itâ€™s running.

==== ownership rules

* each value has a variable thatâ€™s called itâ€™s owner
* there can only be one owner at a time
* when owner goes out of scope, value will be dropped

==== memory and allocation:

===== move

* `String::from`, requests memory it needs
* when a variable goes out of scope, Rust called `drop`, is where author
of `String` can put the code to return the memory.
* to ensure memory safety: after `let s2 = s1`, Rust considers `s1` to
no longer be valid; no need to free anything when `s1` goes out of
scope.

[source,rust]
----
    let s1 = String::from("hello");
    let s2 = s1;

    println!("{}, world!", s1);
----

* move: shallow copy and invalidates the first variable.
* Rust never automatically creates deep copies; any automatic copies are
assumed to be inexpensive.

===== clone

* deeply copy the heap data, not just stack data
* expensive

===== copy

* types that have known size at compile time are stored entirely on the
stack, so copies of actual type are quick to make.
* thereâ€™s no reason we would want to prevent `x` from being valid after
creating `y`.

[source,rust]
----
    let x = 5;
    let y = x;

    println!("x = {}, y = {}", x, y);
----

* no difference between deep and shallow copy here.
* Rust has special annotation called `Copy` trait that is placed on
types like integers.
* Rust wonâ€™t let us annotate a type with `Copy` trait if the type or any
parts of it has implemented `Drop` trait.

==== ownership and functions

* passing a `String`, s, to a function means that s is no longer valid,
the function _owns_ s.
* returning values can also transfer ownership.
* ownership of a variable follows the same pattern: assigning a value to
another variable moves it.
* when a variable that includes data on the heap goes out of scope, the
value will be cleaned up by `drop` unless the data has been moved to be
owned by another variable.
* taking ownership and then returning ownership with every function is a
bit tedious.
** what if we want to let a function use a value but not take ownership?
* anything we pass in also needs to be passed back if we want to use it
again.

[source,rust]
----
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello");

    let (s2, len) = calculate_length(s1);

    println!("The length of '{}' is {}.", s2, len);
}

fn calculate_length(s: String) -> (String, usize) {
    let length = s.len(); // len() returns the length of a String

    (s, length)
}
----

* we can return multiple values in a tuple, and we need to return the
string so we can use it again later.
* we solve that issue by using _references_

=== 4.2 references and borrowing

* add `&` to denote _references_, allow you to refer to some value
without taking ownership of it.
** called borrowing: we cannot modify a borrowed value; _references_ are
also immutable.

==== mutable references

[arabic]
. change the variable to be `mut`: `let mut s = String::from("hello")`
. create a mutable reference with `&mut s` and call the `change`
function: `change(&mut s)`
. update the function signature to accept mutable reference,
`some_string: &mut String`

* but you can only have one mutable reference to a particular piece of
data at a time.
* allows for mutation in a controlled fashion.
* this prevents data races at compile time

a _data race_ is similar to a race condition and occurs when: 1. two or
more pointers access the same data at the same time 2. at least one of
the pointers is being used to write to the data 3. thereâ€™s no mechanism
being used to synchronize access to the data

Rust wonâ€™t even compile code with data races! - we can use curly braces
to create a new scope.

== 5: Using Structs to Structure Related Data

=== 5.1 Defining and Instantiating Structs

* more flexible than tuples.
* use the init shorthand to above being repetitive.

==== Creating Instances From Other Instances With Struct Update Syntax

* `..` specifies that the remaining fields not explicitly set should
have the same value as the fields in the given instance.
** must come last

If we did:

[source,rust]
----
let user2 = User {
  email: String::from("yeet@dab.com"),
  ..user1
  }
----

* this means user1 is not longer usable
** but if there are traits that use the `Copy` trait, then user1 is
still valid

==== Unit-Like Structs Without Any Fields

* useful when you need to implement a trait on some type bot donâ€™th ave
any data that you want to store in the type itself

== 5.2: Method Syntax

* first parameter is always self in the form `self`, `&self`,
`&mut self`
* to define function within context of a Struct, start with an `impl`
block.

=== Associated functions

* donâ€™t have `self`, so arenâ€™t methods because they donâ€™t need an
instance of the type to work with.

....
impl Rectangle {
    fn square(size: u32) -> Rectangle {
        Rectangle {
            width: size,
            height: size,
        }
    }
}

let sq = Rectangle::square(3);
....

* you can have multiple `impl` blocks

== 6. Enums and Pattern Matching

* enums allow you to define a type by enumerating itâ€™s possible
variants.

=== 6.1. Defining an Enum

IP addresses are either V4 or V6, but not both.

[source,rust]
----
enum IpAddrKind {
  V4,
  V6
}
----

* create instances of enum:

[source,rust]
----
let four = IpAddrKind::V4;
let six = IpAddrKind::V6;
----

`four` and `six` have the same type.

* to represent data, might put a enum in a struct. but can put data
directly into each enum variant.

[source,rust]
----
enum IpAddrKind {
  V4(String),
  V6(String)
}

let four = IpAddrKind::V4(String::from("111"));
----

another advantage to using enums rather than a struct is that each
variant can have different types and amounts of associated data.

==== The `Option`

[source,rust]
----
enum Option<T> {
    None,
    Some(T),
}
----

you have to convert `Option<T>` to a `T` before you can perform `T`
operations with it.

=== 6.2 the `match` Control Flow Construct

* match arms can bind to parts of the values that match the pattern;
this is how values are extracted out of enum variants.
* matches are exhaustive
* `catch` catches everything else
* `_` catches any value and does not bind to that value
** `_ => ()`: do nothing

=== 6.3. Concise Control Flow with `if let`

* handle values that match one pattern while ignoring the rest
* lose exhaustive checking that `match` enforces
* can use `else` to make exhaustive

== 7. Managing Growing Projects with Packages, Crates and Modules

the module system: - packages: cargo feature that lets you build, test,
and share crates - crates: tree of modules that produces a library or
executable - modules and use: let you control the org, scope, and
privacy of paths - paths: a way of naming an item, such as a struct,
function, or module

=== project/crates

* crate: binary or library
** crate root: source file that Rust compiler starts from
* package: one or more creates that provide set of functionality;
package contains a `Cargo.toml` file that describes how to build those
crates
** can contain at most one library crate

=== modules

* `src/main.rs`, `src/lib.rc`: crate roots
** contents of either of these two files form a module called `crate` at
root of the crateâ€™s module structure, known as the module tree.
* `use`: brings a path into scope
* `pub`: makes items public
* `mod`: define module with

=== paths

* two forms:
** absolute: starts from crate root by using crate name or literal
`crate`
** relative: starts from current module and uses `self`, `super`, or an
identifier in the current module
* both types of paths followed by one or more identifiers separated by
double colons `::`
* all items are private by default
* items in parent module canâ€™t use the private items inside child
modules, but items in child modules can use the items in their ancestor
modules
** child modules can see the context in which theyâ€™re defined
** hiding inner implementation details is the default
** expose inner parts of child modulesâ€™ code to outer ancestor modules
by using the `pub` keyword to make an item public
* adding `pub` to the module makes the module public but itâ€™s contents
are still private; only code in its ancestor modules can refer to it
* using `super` with relative paths is like using `..`
* adding `pub` to struct makes struct public but fields are still
private
* if we make enum public then all of its variants are public

=== use

* to use module without the long path names
* functions: bring in functionâ€™s parent module => makes it clear the
function isnâ€™t locally defined
* structs, enums, other items: specify full path name
* provide new name with `as`, like Python
* reexporting: combine `pub` and `use`

== 8. Common Collections

* unlike built in arrays/tuples, these collections have their data
stored on the heap, so the amount of data doesnâ€™t need to be known at
compile time and data can grow and shrink as program runs.

3 common types: - vector: store variable number of values next to each
other - string: collection of charterers - hash map: associate value
with particular key

=== vector `Vec<T>`:

* only store values of same type
* `vec!` macro which creates a new vector that holds values you give it
* dropping a vector drops itâ€™s elements
* access elements through `[]` (less safe) or `get()` (more safe)
* same rule of not being able to have mutable and immutable references
applies for vectors:

[source,rust]
----
let mut v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

let first = &v[0]; // immutable borrow

v.push(6); // mutable borrow

println!("The first element is: {}", first);
----

* doesnâ€™t work because of how vectors work: vectors put values next to
each other in memory
** adding a new element onto the end might require allocating new memory
and copying old elements into new space, then `first` would be pointing
to deallocated memory

=== String

* string slice `str` or `&str`
* `String`type: growable, mutable, owned, UTF-8 encoded string type
** `String::from` and `to_string` do the same thing

[source,rust]
----
let s1 = String::from("Hello, ");
let s2 = String::from("world!");
let s3 = s1 + &s2; // note s1 has been moved here and can no longer be used
----

Rust strings donâ€™t support indexing - `String` is wrapper over `Vec<u8>`
- index into a stringâ€™s bytes will not always correlate with valid
Unicode scalar value - if &``hello''[0] were valid code that returned
the byte value, it would return 104, not h - three ways to look at
strings: bytes, scalar values and grapheme clusters - indexing
operations are expected to take constant time `O(1)`, but itâ€™s not
possible because Rust has to walk thought the contents to determine how
many valid characters there are - can use range to create string slices,
but can crash your program - be explicit if you want `chars` or `bytes`

=== Hash Maps `HashMap<K, V>`

* store data on the heap
* ways to construct:
** `use`

[source,rust]
----
use std::collections:HashMap;

let mut map = HashMap::new();

mut.insert(String::from("Yeet"), 1);
----

* iterators and `collect` method on vector of tuples

[source,rust]
----
use std::collections:HashMap;

let keys = vec![String::from("A"),String::from("B")];
let vals = vec![1,2];

let mut map: HashMap<_._> = keys.into_iter().zip(vals.into_iter()).collect();
----

* uses _SipHash_ which provides resistance to DoS attacks but is not the
fastest hashing function.

== 9. Error Handling

* does not have exceptions, has:
** `Result<T ,E>` for recoverable errors
** `panic!` macro that stops execution when the program encounters an
unrecoverable error

=== `panic!` macro

* when `panic!` macro executes, program will print fail message, unwind
and clean stack, then quit
* the stack can either be:
** unwind: Rust walks back up the stack and cleans up the data from each
function it encounters, however, this is a lot of work
** abort: ends program without cleaning up; the memory will need to be
cleaned by the operating system

=== recoverable errors with `Result`

* two generic type parameters: `T`, type of value that will be returned
in success case within `Ok` variant, and `E`, type of error that will be
returned in failure case within `Err` variant.
* can use `match` on the `Results`

=== shortcuts for Panic on Error: `unwrap` and `expect`

* `unwrap`: if `Result` value is:
** `Ok`: return value inside `Ok`
** `Err`: call `panic!` macro
* `expect`: letâ€™s us choose our own error message

=== shortcut for propagating errors:

* `?` placed after `Result` value is defined to work in almost the same
way as `match`
** difference: error values that have `?` called on them go through the
`from` function, which is used to convert errors from one type into
another
*** the error type received is converted into the error type defined in
the return type ### where `?` can be used
* can only be used in functions whose return type of compatible with the
value the `?` is used on
* you can use `?` on a `Result` in a function that returns `Result`
* you can use `?` on an `Option` in a function that returns `Option`

== 10. Generic Types, Traits and Lifetimes

=== in method definitions

[source,rust]
----
impl<T> Point<T> {
    fn x(&self) -> &T {
        &self.x
    }
}
----

* Methods written within an `impl` that declares the generic type will
be defined on any instance of the type, no matter what concrete type
ends up substituting for the generic type.

[source,rust]
----
impl Point<f32> {
    fn distance_from_origin(&self) -> f32 {
        (self.x.powi(2) + self.y.powi(2)).sqrt()
    }
}
----

* means only the type `Point<f32>` will have this method defined.

=== performance of code using generics

* code with generics doesnâ€™t run any slower
* Rust performs monomorphization: process of turning generic code into
specific code by filling in the concrete types

==== Traits

* use traits to define shared behaviour in abstract way.
* use trait bounds to specify that a generic type can be any type that
has certain behaviour
* similar to interfaces in other languages
* we can implement a trait on a type only if at least one of the trait
or the type is local to our crate
** canâ€™t implement external traits on external types
*** coherence, orphan rule => parent type is not present
*** rule ensures other peopleâ€™s code canâ€™t break your code
*** without rule, two creates could implement same trait for the same
type, and Rust wouldnâ€™t know which implementation to use
* canâ€™t call default implementation from overriding implementation of
same method.
* trait bounds:

[source,rust]
----
pub fn notify<T: Summary>(item1: &T, item2: &T) {
----

* multiple trait bounds with +:

[source,rust]
----
pub fn notify(item: &(impl Summary + Display)) {
pub fn notify<T: Summary + Display>(item: &T) {
----

* clearer trait bounds with `where` Clauses

[source,rust]
----
fn some_function<T, U>(t: &T, u: &U) -> i32
    where T: Display + Clone,
          U: Clone + Debug
{
----

* can only return a single type (even if the trait is in the return)
* can use traits to conditionally implement methods
* can also conditionally implement a trait for any type that implements
another trait
** implementations of a trait on any type that satisfies the trait
bounds are called _blanket implementations_

=== validating references with lifetimes

* main aim is to prevent dangling pointers
* Rust determines code has gone out of scope with a borrow checker

=== generic lifetimes in functions

[source,rust]
----
fn longest(x: &str, y: &str) -> &str {
    if x.len() > y.len() {
        x
    } else {
        y
    }
}
----

* this code doesnâ€™t compile; we donâ€™t know if `&str` refers to `x` or
`y`.
* borrow checker canâ€™t check either; add generic lifetime parameters

*Lifetime Annotation Syntax* - lifetime annotations donâ€™t chance how
long any of the references live - lifetime annotations describe
relationships of the lifetimes of multiple references to each other
without affecting the lifetime

[source,rust]
----
&i32        // a reference
&'a i32     // a reference with an explicit lifetime
&'a mut i32 // a mutable reference with an explicit lifetime
----

* when we specify lifetime parameters, weâ€™re not changing the lifetime
of values, only telling the borrow checked to reject any values that
donâ€™t adhere to these restraints.
* lifetime annotations become part of the contract of the function
* return value lifetime needs to be related to the lifetime of something
(parameter or value created)
* patterns programmed into Rustâ€™s analysis of references: _lifetime
elision rules_
** set of particular cases that the compiler will consider, and if your
code fits these cases you donâ€™t need to write lifetime explicitly
* input lifetime: lifetimes on functions or method parameters
* output lifetime: lifetime on return values
* three rules to figure out what lifetimes references have when there
arenâ€™t explicit annotations:
[arabic]
. each parameter that is a reference gets its own lifetime parameter
. second rule is if there is exactly one input lifetime parameter, that
lifetime is assigned to all output lifetime parameters
. there are multiple input lifetime parameters, but one of them is
`&self` or `&mut self` because this is a method, the lifetime of self is
assigned to all output lifetime parameters
* `'static` lifetime, which means the reference can live for the entire
duration of the program

== 13. FP Features: Iterators and Closures

* closure: anonymous function that capture their environment
** can save in a variable or pass as arguments
* `let` statement means it contains the definition of an anonymous
function, but not the resulting value of calling the anonymous function
* there arenâ€™t type annotations in the closure definition
* closures donâ€™t require you to annotate types of the parameters or the
return type like `fn` functions do
* type annotations are required for functions because theyâ€™re part of an
explicit interface exposed to users
** important so everyone agrees on what types of values a function uses
and returns
* closures arenâ€™t used in exposed interface like this. # 14. Cargo and
