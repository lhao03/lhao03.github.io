|1
|I'm falling asleep.
|I don't understand a single sentence.

|2
|Reading through the paper is a like a task and I'd rather read another paper.
|I know less than half of the key words and have a very limited (non existent) understanding of the paper.

|3
|
|I know most key words but I can't really understand the main idea of the paper.

|4
|
|I know most words and understand the idea but get lost still.

|5
|The paper is neutral. I don't mind reading it, but I don't think I'd miss reading it.
|I know most key words and have a general idea of the topic of the paper but couldn't explain much about the paper to anyone.

|6
|Has some interesting points.
|I can get a good idea about the topic of the paper, but can't really form any questions or my own thoughts on the paper and I have trouble talking about the paper to someone else and have to refer back.

|7
|
|I can understand the paper and overarching ideas and details well, and have some of my own thoughts on the paper, but those thoughts may be half baked. I can get a general idea of the paper across to someone without needing to refer back the paper.

|8
|
|I've come across the same problem/topic in the paper, and understand the ideas and solutions presented, and could talk about them with someone else.

|9
|
|I've also thought about the same ideas and come across the same research problem. I can lightly debate about the paper with someone else and can think of questions to ask the authors.

|10
|I feel excited reading this and would love researching more about this topic.
|I could of written this myself (well not really)! I could probably present the paper to someone else clearly and have a conversation with the authors.
