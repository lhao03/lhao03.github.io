title: Reflection on StarHacks (gender focused hackathons)
tags: hackathons, feminism
---

Positives: 
* diverse role models (age, interests, ethnicity) and workshop topics
* not too "girlified"
* attracting lots of "new programmers"
* creating content that is unique
* increased interest and perhaps usefulness?

Negatives:
* many topics are not really "computer science" => not selling the whole narrative
* perception of beginner friendly
* segregation of women
* hackathon
* good mentors

Papers talk about women are more likely to learn computing if they realized it was "useful" or could be used for good. Why doesn't this thinking apply to men? Why are women required to "do good"?
