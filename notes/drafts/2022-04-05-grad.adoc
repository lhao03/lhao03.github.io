I'm officially starting to prep for grad schol (for real). These are my notes, and if you're hoping to follow a similar academic journey as me, then here are my goals:

1. Apply for grad school to study physical chemistry or quantum chemistry or computational chemistry (inclusive or)
2. Select a well-rounded list of grad schools to apply to
3. Narrow down what I realy want to do research in

This is my 3rd (?) attempt at preparing to apply to grad school. My previous attempts at preparing to apply for grad school were for the areas of computer science (PL) and chemical biology, both areas which I didn't completely align with. This time I will be looking at grad schools with the intention of studying physics, chemistry and computer science.

** "Unlike at many other universities, the doctorate at ETH Zurich is not organised via an overarching doctoral school. ETH Zurich mainly offers individual doctorates. Each potential doctoral thesis supervisor recruits their doctoral students themselves. In order to be able to complete a doctorate at ETH, a professor at ETH must be willing to supervise your dissertation."

* https://ethz.ch/content/dam/ethz/common/docs/publications/education/doctorate_brochure.pdf
** "The admission requirements for a doctorate at ETH Zurich
are a Master’s degree from a recognized university and
excellent academic performance."

==== Application Details 
* superior performance and research experience in past two years of undergrad studies 

* statement of purpose 

* personal history statement 

** The personal statement should give concrete evidence of your promise as a member of the academic community, giving the committee an image of you as a person. 

** This is also where you represent your potential to bring to your academic career a critical
perspective rooted in a non-traditional educational background, or your
understanding of the experiences of groups historically
under-represented in higher education and your commitment to increase
participation by a diverse population in higher education.

*** how enzymes function as such formidable catalysts 
*** The role of non-covalent interactions between the enzyme and substrate in stabilisation of ground and
transition states has held a particular fascination for me, as well as
the development of methodologies to stabilise or trap intermediates in
catalysis. Increasingly I am becoming interested in applying our
understanding to the development of new tools and hopefully
therapeutics.
