== GenoM3: Building middleware-independent robotic components

=== background on middleware-independent components
- build abstraction layer on top of replaceable software
- normalization/standardization: more elegant
- problems with current robot middleware:
  - does not fit well with dataflow oriented context
  - no tools to build dynamic architectures
  - not much normalization
- "Indeed, normalization is usually achieved only for mastered and
well understood issues — at the cost of taking the least common denominator of technologies encompassed by the norm — and robotic middleware might not be mature enough to pass this step."
- alternative: middleware interoperability
  - bridging components, extra conversions or data (re)encoding
- genoM3: general approach
  - algorithmic core made independent of middleware via. glue
  - component functions formally describe input/output objects they use
  - glue code makes necessary calls to middleware and passes/retrieves objects
  - glue code is autogenerated
- historically: generated code of components from single, generic code
  - evolution: templates
  - component description file: contains all information to describe the component, the parser builds AST and converts to "suitable representation for scripting language of template interpreter"
- codels: individual functions that only perform elementary actions
- component models
  - general properties
    - components: executable programs
      - must define internal data structure
      - execution tasks that are periodic or aperiodic
- component description language
  - component defined by 1. codels, 2. specialization file that completly defines the component
