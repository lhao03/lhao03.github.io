title: A universal system for digitization and automatic execution of the chemical synthesis literature

* current automation shifts labor from manual to programming
* chemputer requires manual translation
* need universal chemical language => universal chemistry-orientated DSL => map methodology to hardware-agnostic chemical instruction
* make chemical literature directly
* propose XDL (kai DL): processes taking place in abstract vessels with abstract hardware => determines which pieces of hardware are required
* creation of ChemIDE => way for chemist to put in synthesis without actually seeing the code => import literature using SynthReader
** tagging text with relavent entities => convert tagged text to list of actions => add implicit process information + concreate reagent locations
* steps are connected by processes
* SynthReader => domain specific algorithm with predefined rules
** "and can be easily augmented withnew rules, as the design is deterministic."
* expand each XDL into a tree
* XDL library currently has "low-level" constraints => hope to expand with reaction types
** chemical code written against a chemical virutal machine
