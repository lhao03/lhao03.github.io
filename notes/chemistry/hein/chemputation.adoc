* chemical reactions: 2d pictures
* OFAT: one factor at at time
* lots of assumed knowledge, so conditions not always outlined
* actual description recorded in prose
* reaction => workup => isolation => purification
* ORD: open-access repository of chemical reactions
* flow chemistry => key enabling technologies for automation
* closed-loop reaction optimization: automated processing, analysis of analytical data in real time
* algorithms for decision making: Nelderâˆ’Mead Simple and gradient based => can't tackle noise
** The SNOBFIT algorithm: first to tackle noise
** also Bayesian optimization
** challenge: incorporating chemical knowledge into workflow => treat chemical reaction as black box, ignore physical properties/data from published results/chemical databases
*** nearest neighbour approach
*** neural network approach (on large database), bayesian optmization, chemical encoding (using DFT-descriptors)
