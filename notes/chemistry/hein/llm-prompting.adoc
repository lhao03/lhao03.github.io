* tasks require commonsense:
** object affordances
** logical sequence of actions
** task relevance of objects/actions

* but this requires: state feedback/knowledge of current environment
* provide LLM with
** with Pythonic header with import statement for availble actions and their parameters,
** list of environment objects,
** function definitions

* preconditions
* respond to failed assertions with recovery actions

== background/related work
* heuristics to guide search
* task planning as a tuple (O, P, A, T, I, G, t)
** O: objects
** P: properties => object affordances
** A: set of executable actions, changes depending on current state
*** state s is specific assignment of all objects

* prompt for task planning:
** prompting function: transform input state into textual prompt
** answer search: generation step

* open-ended task planning: generated plans with non existant objects
** programming language inspired prompt generator -> inform LLM of situatated environment state + avalible robot actions

" PDDL as the translation language instead of code, and use the LLM to generate either a PDDL plan or the goal. ... This approach ablated the need to generate preconditions using the LLM, however, needs the domain rules to be specified for the planner."

== progprompt
* robot plans as pythonic code
* intermediate summaries, chain of thought
* assertions for environment feedback + error recovery
* provide LLM with examples/samples
* objects with state
* use program like prompt
* LLM strengthes: commonsense reasoning and code understanding

=== personal thoughts
* verifier needs to be some type of graph
