== ChatMOF: an artificial intelligence system for predicting and generating metal-organic frameworks using large language models

- three components: agent (create a plan to solve the problem), tooklit, evaluator (provides a response)
- LLM as central coordinator
- LLM uses tools, via Thought, Action, Action Input
- uses LangChain

== Leveraging large language models for predictive chemistry
- large LLM as bootstrap

== Augmenting large language models with chemistry tools

== Autonomous chemical research with large language models
