title: Applying quantum mechanics to deconvolute benchtop H NMR reaction data
---

* NMR: structural and quantitative information, non destructive
* not much use of benchtop NMR (larmor frequency less than 125 MHz) due to reduced sensitivity + signal dispersion => QM spectral analysis
** signal sensitivity: address partially with increasing analyte concentration / hyperpolarization
** signal overlap: more of an issue with H NMR because of small range => success depends on if signals are well-resolved
* strategies to deal with signal overlap
** data driven approach: PLSR, constructing mathematical relationship between spectral featyres + component concentrations from training set => deconvolution

** model driven approach: IHM, model underlying physics of observed spectra
*** observed spectrum = weighted sume of individual peak functions
*** "build individual component peak functions (model files) from observed pure component spectra"
*** mixture model built and fit to observed spectra
** model based approach using QM spectral analysis => use NMR spin parameters to simulte NMR spectra

* HF vs. benchtop NMR:
** signals not as distinguishable with benchtop, much more signal overlap
** QMSA used HF data to make mixture model file

* QMSA vs. IHM results for benchtop NMR
** estimated rate constants faster (when monitored with benchtop) => due to higher temperature
** IHM worklfow didn't fit proposed kinetic model as well as QMSA
*** QMSA is descriptive to NMR, while IHM generic peak functions were used
*** also peak functions were created empirically, so IHM could be over/under fit
