title: "Automation isn't automatic"

== introduction
* recent shift to flexible, modular systems with autonomous decision making vs. simple automation
* how can we automate synthethic chemistry in general?
* three categories to consider
** equipment considerations
** experimental considerations
** data and software

== equipment considerations
* translocation:
** cartesian: a needle in the z-axis, moving in the xy plane
*** researcher must adapt workflow to actions the robot can perform
** SCARA: a bit better
** universal robots UR3: widest range of motion (6 DoFs)

=== robustness and maintenance
* components being unable to perform needed task
* system failures due to improper coding
* the more complicated the system gets, the more reliability checks are required to not break the system

=== planning
* design of experiments (DoE) /principal component analysis (PCA)
* special chemical requirements
* feedback control: automated-design making -> define experimental goal with conditional instructions, and system makes decisions autonomously
