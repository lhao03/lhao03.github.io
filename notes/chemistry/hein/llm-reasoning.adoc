== Towards Reasoning in Large Language Models: A Survey

== The Neuro-Symbolic Inverse Planning Engine (NIPE): Modeling Probabilistic Social Inferences from Linguistic Inputs
- what is bayesian inverse planning??

== Tree of Thoughts: Deliberate Problem Solving with Large Language Models

== Pragmatic Instruction Following and Goal Assistance via Cooperative Language-Guided Inverse Planning

== Sequential Monte Carlo Steering of Large Language Models using Probabilistic Programs

== Integrating action knowledge and LLMs for task planning and situation handling in open worlds

== Inferring the Goals of Communicating Agents from Actions and Instructions
- multi-modal Bayesian inverse planning from actions and instructions
- model human linguistic/action understanding as processes of bayesian interpretation
  - BToM: humans understand each other actions by inferring goals/beliefs that explain those actions as rational
  - RSA: interpret not just on bare semantics, but also pragmatic intentions they imply
  - achieve joint inference from action + uttered instructions
- rather than assistant infer principal's goal -> infer team's goal given their actions/communciated instructions
- model team as group agent -> bypass challenge of recursive mental reasoning
- probabilistic program: goal prior, joint planner, utterance model
  - easily integrate LLMs are flexible utterance likelihoods
  - LLMs used as modular components to larger probabilistic models
- probabilistic program with deterministic, stochastic and neural components

== Grounding Language about Belief in a Bayesian Theory-of-Mind

== Grounded physical language understanding with probabilistic programs and simulated worlds
- mental physics engine?
- physics in a language of thought -> maps language into probabilistic language of thought + physics simulation and inference
- construct linguistic meaning from cognitive represenation in compositional language of thought
- probabilistic programs grounded in physics engine
- PiLoT: probabiltic generative model, language-to-code model, physics simulator
- LLM struggle with number/spatial relations
