== Artificial intelligenceâ€‘driven shimming for parallel high field nuclear magnetic resonance
- what is shimming:
  - https://web.mit.edu/8.13/www/pdf_files/shimming.pdf
  - https://scs.illinois.edu/system/files/inline-files/ShimmingNMR_Magnet.pdf
  - https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/chemistry/shimming
  - adjust currents in shim lines to optimize homogeneity of magenetic field
  - adjust homogeneity of an NMR magnet
  - integration of the NMR signal response
    - which part of the NMR sample experiencing magnetic inhomogeneity is lost in integration process
- what the paper did/claims:
  - "Here we show that, by centering a separate shim system over each detector and employing deep learning to cope with overlapping non-orthogonal shimming fields, parallel detectors can be rapidly calibrated."
  - DL: map 1D-NMR spectra to shim values, so instead of iterative optimizaiton or predefined shim maps -> predict optimal shim values with a few NMR aquisitions
- conventional NMR too slow: low throughput due to sample loading, coil tuning, magnetic field shimming -> parallel NMR spectroscopy
  - paralell also has trouble: "independent unperturbed operation of the parallel detector site"
- NMR probe: sensitive RF coil to detect NMR signals with high spectral resolution
  - stripline coils in MF applications -> high throughput screening + continuous flow measurement, but never applied in parallel

=== results
- homonuclear parallel NMR: directly compare signal from similar samples, but introduces signal coupling between two channels
  - both coils simul excite and recieve signals
  - minimize with time-interleaved pulse sequence -> not true synchonization

==== ai-driven shimming for parallel spectroscopy
- more data, less error
- ai vs. traditional methods
  - shimming based on
    - parabolic interpolation (3 vertices)
      - m * n * 3 aquisitions
    - simplex algorithm (n+1 vertices), evolve through shim space until finding minimum
      - (m * n)

==== AI Concept
- multiple channels used to aquire signals from different ROI
  - parallel requires more considerations -> shim interactions / RF couplings between channels
  - AI can handle high-dimensional and non-linear nature of shimming problem
  - AI can adapt to non-orthogonal shim fields + find good shim settings for each channel
