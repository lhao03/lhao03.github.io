* Limits
** Archimedes
- method of exhaustion: problem solved by infinite process
  - to make this reasoning rigourous -> need concept of limit
- how to find pi:
  - used bounds to constrain unknown value

** Fermat
- limit to find the slope of tangent line

** Newton/Leibniz
- development of calculus

** Bolzano, Cauchy, Weierstrass
- made the idea more firm footing

$$\frac{sin(x)}{sin(x)} > \frac{sin(x)}{x} > \frac{sin(x)}{tan(x)}$$

- this lets us bound $$/frac{sin(x)}{x}$$ between 1 and $$cos(x)$$
- then as $$x$$ goes to 0, $$cos(x)$$ goes to 1
